2025,AIAA-2016-5305,Engineering the CisLunar Economic System based on ULA's CisLunar-1000 Vision,"Currently, there are at most six human astronauts living and working in space aboardthe International Space Station (ISS). There are many proposed plans to develop the in-frastructure to support more humans living o -Earth. Speci cally, the United LaunchAlliance (ULA) Cis-Lunar-1000 concept culminates in the establishment of a communityof 1000 humans living and working in space within 30 years (2046). The economic viabil-ity of the Cis-Lunar-1000 plan is explored by considering Lunar-derived resources, presentlaunch service trends, satellite needs and services, and ULAs proposed Advanced CryogenicEvolved Stage (ACES) vehicle for Cis-Lunar resource distribution. This study develops astand-alone systems model to predict the economic opportunities in 30 years using pro-posed future space industry sectors such as in-space manufacturing, lunar resource mining,increased on-orbit consumable demands, and Cis-Lunar transport services. The model iscalibrated with good agreement to the FAA Compendium on Commercial Space Operationsand Satellite Industry Association's Annual State of the Satellite Industry presentation de-veloped by the Tauri Group. The manuscript presents both technical and economic analysissupporting the viability of the Cis-Lunar-1000 concept.","Engineering the Cis-lunar Economic System based on"
2026,AIAA-2016-5306,Architecture Study for a Fuel Depot Supplied From Lunar Resources,"This architecture study sought to determine the optimum architecture for a fuel depot supplied from lunar assets. Four factors ¨C the location of propellant processing (on the Moon or on the depot), the depot location (on the Moon, L1, GEO, or LEO), the propellant transfer location (L1, GEO, or LEO), and the propellant transfer method (bulk fuel or canister exchange) were combined to identify 18 candidate architectures. Two design reference missions (DRMs) ¨C a commercial satellite servicing mission and a Government cargo mission to Mars ¨C created demand for propellants, while a propellant delivery DRM examined supply issues. The study concluded Earth-Moon L1 is the best location for an orbiting depot. For all architectures, propellant boiloff was less than anticipated, and was far overshadowed by delta-v requirements and resulting fuel consumption. Bulk transfer is the most flexible for both the supplier and customer. However, since canister exchange bypasses the transfer of bulk cryogens and necessary chilldown losses, canister exchange shows promise and merits further investigation. Overall, this work indicates propellant consumption and loss is an essential factor in assessing fuel depot architectures.","Architecture Study for a Fuel Depot Supplied from Lunar "
2027,AIAA-2016-5307,The Threat of Uncertainty - Why Using Traditional Approaches for Evaluating Spacecraft Reliability Are Insufficient for Future Human Mars Missions,"limited to no opportunities for resupply, the distance from Earth, mass and volume constraints of spacecraft, high sensitivity of transportation element designs to variation in mass, the lack of abort opportunities to Earth, limited hardware heritage information, and the operation of human-rated systems in a radiation environment with little to no experience. The current approach to maintainability, as implemented on ISS, which includes a large number of spares pre-positioned on ISS, a larger supply sitting on Earth waiting to be flown to ISS, and an on demand delivery of logistics from Earth, is not feasible for future deep space human missions. For missions beyond LEO, significant modifications to the maintainability approach will be required.","The Threat of Uncertainty ¨C Why Using Traditional "
2028,AIAA-2016-5321,Performance Efficient Launch Vehicle Recovery and Reuse,"For decades, economic reuse of launch vehicles has been an elusive goal. Recent attemptsat demonstrating elements of launch vehicle recovery for reuse have invigorated a debateover the merits of different approaches. The parameter most often used to assess the cost ofaccess to space is dollars-per-kilogram to orbit. When comparing reusable vs. expendablelaunch vehicles, that ratio has been shown to be most sensitive to the performance lost as aresult of enabling the reusability. This paper will briefly review the historical backgroundand results of recent attempts to recover launch vehicle assets for reuse. The business casefor reuse will be reviewed, with emphasis on the performance expended to recover thoseassets, and the practicality of the most ambitious reuse concept, namely propulsive return tothe launch site.","Performance Efficient Launch Vehicle Recovery and Reuse "
2029,AIAA-2016-5322,Assessing Factors that Affect the Safety of Space Launch and Reentry Operations in the National Airspace System,The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is faced with the challenge of integrating newer and more frequent launch and re-entry vehicle (LRV) operations while minimizing effects on other National Airspace System (NAS) users and maintaining safety. Current LRV operations require the FAA to segregate large amounts of airspace with Aircraft Hazard Areas (AHAs) to maintain safety and account for unforeseen events such as vehicle breakup. This practice requires other NAS users to reroute and plan their operations around the AHAs. The FAA and The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) are working together in a variety of areas to more efficiently integrate the growing number of LRV operations while minimizing effects on all NAS users.,"Assessing Factors that Affect the Safety of Space Launch "

2034,AIAA-2016-5545,Towards a methodology and tooling for Model-Based Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA),"A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) aims to identify and assess potential risks to system technical performance requirements for the purpose of furnishing risk insights into project decisions. PRAs have traditionally been conducted manually using software with an isolated data model. As system complexity rises it becomes difficult to ensure consistency between a PRA, the evolving system design, and other engineering analyses; the techniques for conducting PRAs must evolve to meet this challenge. This work presents progress towards a methodology and tooling for conducting a PRA by leveraging data in the system model embedded for other purposes and analyses. An approach for identifying the appropriate probabilistic equation for each risk scenario from a standard library is presented, which is a significant step towards the quantification of the likelihood of a risk scenario occurrence. The final calculation of the likelihood of occurrence is left as an item of future work. We also present the development of preliminary tooling to carry out the methodology on a well-formed system model. The information needed to conduct the PRA is embedded in a consistent manner in a system model, so the model-based PRA can be regularly executed as the system model changes. The ability to modify the PRA in concert with lifecycle evolution affords a project the opportunity to track the extent to which system modification impacts compliance with requirements. These aspects of this model-based PRA methodology make it capable of managing risk in increasingly complex technical systems.","Towards a methodology and tooling for Model-Based "

2037,AIAA-2016-5548,Assesing Terra Disposal Orbit Candidates from an Orbital Debris Perspective,"The NASA Terra satellite is reaching the end of its mission life. Because the satellite resides in the 705 km Earth Science Constellation, disposal strategies need to be considered to remove it from this densely populated operational orbit. Of critical importance was the need to examine the future potential risk to other satellite residents of the 705 km constellation due to an unexpected breakup event of the Terra satellite post-disposal. This study quantifies the comparative risk of debris impacts associated with the two leading candidate disposal orbits (701 km vs. 686 km) and characterizes the suitability of each orbit for the purpose of long-term spacecraft disposal. The increase in collision risk to any member of the 705 km Earth Science Constellation is very modest.","AIAA-2016-5548 "

2041,AIAA-2016-5523,Numerical Evaluation of The Effect of Icing Accretion on An Airship,"Ice accretion on an airship is conducted using numerical simulation to evaluate its effectson the operation performance of the airship. With the help of the FENSAP-ICE icingsimulation system, the CFD icing calculations in 2D and 3D are solved. The initial airflowsolutions are conducted based on the Reynolds-averaged N-S equations and S-A turbulentmodel. Eulerian method is used in calculating the air-water two-phase flow field and solvingthe collection efficiency distribution. Then the ice shape is built with the assumption that iceaccretes along the direction normal to the surface. The ice accretions on a NACA0012 airfoilmodel under different icing conditions are evaluated and the comparison between thesimulation results and experimental data indicates that the approach in this paper is feasibleand effective. Then, the impact of icing accretion on airship flight performance is estimated.The results show that in the conditions of freezing rain and drizzle, ice accretes mainly in theleading edge of the tail and the hull-fin intersection region. The increases in weight causedby icing are obvious. The pitch stability degrades but well within the operational capabilitiesof the airship.","Numerical Evaluation of the Effect of Ice Accretion on an "

2044,AIAA-2016-5709,Development and Characterization of a Small Spacecraft Electro-Optic Scanner for Free-Space Laser Communications,"Emergent     data-intensive     missions     coupled     with     dramatic reductions  in  spacecraft  size  plus  an  increasing  number  of  space-based  missions  necessitates  new  high  performance,  compact  and  low cost  communications  technology.    Free  space  optical  communications offer advantages including orders of magnitude increase for data rate performance,  increased  security,  immunity  to  jamming  and  lack  of frequency  allocation  requirements  when  compared  with  conventional radio   frequency   (RF)   means.      The   spatial   coherence   and   low divergence    associated    with    the    optical    frequencies    of    laser communications  lends  themselves  to  superior  performance,  but  this increased  directionality  also  creates  one  of  the  primarytechnical challenges  in  establishing  a  laser  communications  link  by  repeatedly and  reliably  pointing  the  beam  onto  the  receive  aperture.    Several solutions    have    emerged    from    wide    angle    (slow)    mechanical articulation  systems,  fine  (fast)  steering  mirrors  and  rotating  prisms, inertial  compensation  gyros  and  vibration  isolation  &  cancellation systems,   but   each   requires   moving   components   and   imparts   a measured  amount  of  burden  on  the  host  platform.

2046,AIAA-2016-4952,Reactor Parameters Effects on Hydrogen Production from Hydrogen Sulfide,"Experimental results are presented on the effect of input and reactor operational parameters on the production of hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide to minimize environmental burden. The effect of reactor temperature, residence time and inlet concentration of hydrogen sulfide (5%-100%), on hydrogen and sulfur production from a laboratory-scale reactor are presented. The results revealed a reduction in the production of hydrogen and decrease in conversion of hydrogen sulfide with increase in the inlet hydrogen sulfide concentration. The results also showed that pyrolysis at higher concentrations of hydrogen sulfide promotes occurrence of a more complex reaction chemistry with significant departure from equilibrium simulation. The results provided significant role of reactor temperature, H2S residence time in the reactor, and inlet concentration of H2S on hydrogen production. Higher temperatures enhanced the H2S conversion even at lower residence time. These results provide more favorable operating conditions of the reactor for the treatment of H2S waste streams to produce valuable hydrogen and sulfur. The results also provide viable means of utilizing various waste streams, containing hydrogen sulfide to ease environmental burden in the existing Claus reactors that are used for recovering sulfur and thermal energy. In-situ thermal energy utilization in the process offers opportunity for hydrogen production from the acid gases.","Reactor Parameters Effects on Hydrogen Production from "
2047,AIAA-2016-4953,The Effect of the Fuel Change from Petroleum Kerosene to HEFA Alternative Jet Fuel on the Emission of an RQL Type Gas Turbine Combustor,"The combustion rig test of an RQL gas turbine combustor was performed with petroleum kerosene, 100% hydro-treated ester and fatty acid (HEFA) alternative jet fuel and their blends. The results show the clear tendency of suppression of non-volatile PM (nvPM) emission with the increased blending ratio of HEFA. The O-ring sink test of the fuels was also performed showing the HEFA alternative fuel has less effect on the strength and volume of the O-rings compared with petroleum kerosene. Chemical analysis of both of the fuels shows the difference in aromatic content, where aromatics content of the kerosene reaches up to around 20% while aromatics are not contained in HEFA, which is considered to cause both of the difference in nvPM emission and the effect of the fuels on O-rings.","The effect of the fuel change  "
2048,AIAA-2016-5720,Future Standardization of Space Telecommunications Radio System with Core Flight System,"NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is integrating the NASA Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) Standard with the Core Flight System (cFS), an avionics software operating environment. The STRS standard provides a common, consistent framework to develop, qualify, operate and maintain complex, reconfigurable and reprogrammable radio systems. The cFS is a flexible, open architecture that features a plug-and-play software executive called the Core Flight Executive (cFE), a reusable library of software components for flight and space missions and an integrated tool suite. Together, STRS and cFS create a development environment that allows for STRS compliant applications to reference the STRS application programmer interfaces (APIs) that use the cFS infrastructure. These APIs are used to standardize the communication protocols on NASAs space SDRs. The cFS-STRS Operating Environment (OE) is a portable cFS library, which adds the ability to run STRS applications on existing cFS platforms. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the cFS-STRS OE prototype, preliminary experimental results performed using the Advanced Space Radio Platform (ASRP), the GRC S?band Ground Station and the SCaN (Space Communication and Navigation) Testbed currently flying onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Additionally, this paper presents a demonstration of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services (SOIS) using electronic data sheets (EDS) inside cFE. This configuration allows for the data sheets to specify binary formats for data exchange between STRS applications. The integration of STRS with cFS leverages mission-proven platform functions and mitigates barriers to integration with future missions. This reduces flight software development time and the costs of software-defined radio (SDR) platforms. Furthermore, the combined benefits of STRS standardization with the flexibility of cFS provide an effective, reliable and modular framework to minimize software development efforts for spaceflight missions.","Future Standardization of Space Telecommunications Radio "
2049,AIAA-2016-4797,A novel spiral regenerator suitable for MICSE and the study on its hybrid thermodynamic cycle,"The regenerative ability of MICSE is studied and a spiral regenerator is developed to improve its efficiency in this paper. With a novel regenerator fixed around, the multi-chamber structure for this engine changes, as one chamber is slightly larger the others. This unique larger chamber works in two-stroke cycle, while the other ones with equal volume in four-stroke cycle. Also, only hot exhaust can be compressed into the regenerator for the large one, however both hot exhaust and pre-compressed gas-mixture in the rest ones can flow into the regenerator. In consequence, this special hybrid power cycle, i.e., a chamber in two-stroke cycle and the others in four-stroke cycle exist at the same time in one engine, has not only overcome the operating difficulty caused by the added regenerator but also reduced energy lost by restraining heat leak and recycling the residual heat exits. From the comparison of temperature-entropy diagram for a complete power cycle of engine with and without regenerator, it is deduced that, the mixed power cycle is able to create remarkable thermal-efficiency rise. Applied to the mechanical model in University of Michigan, the efficiency increases by 4.19%.","A novel spiral regenerator suitable for MICSE and the study "

The present study intends to study numerically the problem of NOx emissions using a model of combustion chamber with 200 kW swirl burner utilizing propane as a fuel. The importance of this study is generally due to its relation to the pollutants formed by boiler furnaces and gas turbine combustion chambers, which used broadly in thermal industrial plants. Governing conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy, and equations describing the turbulence, species concentrations, combustion and radiation modeling as well NOx modeling equations were solved together to represent temperature and OH distribution inside the combustion chamber, and the NOx concentration at the combustion chamber exit, at various operating conditions of air to fuel ratio. Particularly, the simulation presented more observation on the interaction between the peak flame temperature and the thermal NOx concentration. The results have shown that the peak flame temperature and NOx concentration increase as the oxygen percent in the oxidizer increases, but after certain threshold the NOx concentration stats to decays dramatically.","Oxidizer Composition Effects on NOx Emissions from "

2055,AIAA-2016-5048,An Experimental Investigation of the Flow Field and Heat Transfer from a Single Impinging Jet with Varying Confinement Conditions,"The high heat transfer capabilities of impinging jets have led to their widespread use in industrial applications, such as gas turbine cooling. In this gas turbine application, impingement holes are manufactured in the walls of superalloy metals, and thus, flow fields of impinging jets are influenced by this confinement. A large portion of existing literature on the subject of impingement does not consider this confinement, and focuses on a more fundamental application of impinging jets open flow fields. This study serves to investigate the resulting differences in the flow field and heat transfer for a semi-confined, axisymmetric, impinging jet originating from a sharp edge orifice. Several different jet diameters and confinement plate diameters are tested in order to achieve various levels of confinement. These results are compared to existing cases in literature which have significantly less confinement. The effects of entrainment and recirculation within the near stagnation flow field were investigated by measuring effectiveness, discharge coefficient, and heat transfer coefficient for the different testing conditions. Radial distributions of effectiveness are measured with high spatial resolution, and indicate there is an appreciable difference between differing confinement levels. The effects of variation in sink pressure is also studied by altering the pressure of the chamber, which houses the target surface, to several values between 0 - 1 psi. This was seen to have little effect on the resulting effectiveness distributions. The Reynolds number, based on jet diameter, in this study varied between 20,000 - 80,000, where the jet to target plate spacing varied between 2 and 6 jet diameters. The effectiveness distributions are Reynolds number independent, and only a function of jet to target surface spacing and the confinement condition. These conclusions are relatively consistent with cases found in literature, however, an appreciable difference is seen to exist which depends on the amount of confinement.","An Experimental Investigation of the Flow Field and Heat "

The optimization result showed that theoptimal strengthening ribs structure is more efficient at heat conduction, and other optimalstructure is more efficient at losing weight.

2057,AIAA-2016-5051,Large eddy simulation of flat plate film cooling flow characteristics based on plasma actuation,"Large eddy simulation (LES) was carried out to investigate the effect of plasmaaerodynamic actuation on improving flat plate film cooling efficiency. In this work, aphenomenological model was adopted to provide the electric field generated by the plasma,resulting in the body force. Results show that with the downward plasma force, thepenetration of the jet into the crossflow is suppressed and the jet trajectory is much closer tothe wall in the vicinity of the cooling hole, so that the strength and the size of the counterrotatingvortex pair are decreased. The anti-kidney shaped vortex induced by the plasmaactuation also weakens the strength of counter-rotating vortex pair. Furthermore, theplasma actuation adds energy into the boundary layer where the fluid is induced toaccelerate, causing the disappearance of crossflow separation vortex pair downstream of thecooling hole, and then the turbulent kinetic energy in the recirculation zone is significantlyreduced, so the film cooling efficiency is enhanced. When the plasma actuation strength is 5,the centerline and the spanwise-averaged film cooling efficiency are improved by 75% and100% at most, compared with the baseline case.","Large Eddy Simulation of Film Cooling Flow "

The model accounts forpressure-dependent ignition, and subsequent burn depends on the local dissipative work,porosity, and pressure. The dependence on dissipative work is motivated by mesoscalesimulations that indicate a signi cant increase in hot-spot size and spatial proximity withinthe microstructure as the e ective (or bulk) shock induced dissipative work increases,suggesting an increase in ame spread rate. Predictions highlight the variation in transitionmechanism with increasing input shock strength and conditions that favor the formationof retonation during transition are identi ed.","The Evolution of Retonation During DDT of Low"

What is being proposed is a philosophical change, based on historical failure modes, to use an FMEA process to screen defects during manufacture instead of relying on elevated dynamics amplitudes to screen defects.

In the past, basic design work and mission trade studies had been conductedas a part of a phase II NIAC program. The present work continues these past studies byexploring various design spaces for the inductively driven liner compression (IDLC) driversystem, which is crucial for the operation of the FDR. The operating condition and designof the IDLC driver system is optimized by running a parametric analysis using a pseudo-1D liner code, which integrates the calculation of the driver circuit, magnetic  eld, Jouleheating, and liner dynamics for the IDLC driver system. The design space is constrainedbased on the past FDR design con guration and considers the IDLC driver con gurationemploying 1 m radius driver coil with lithium liner propellants. Improvements in theperformance were seen for the considered IDLC driver con guration, compared with thesimilar study conducted in the past for the IDLC driver system using 15 cm radius coilwith aluminum liner propellant.

On-board the spacecraft is anion propulsion system (IPS) developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for theheliocentric transfer to Vesta, orbit capture at Vesta, transfer between Vesta scienceorbits, departure and escape from Vesta, heliocentric transfer to Ceres, orbitcapture at Ceres, transfer between Ceres science orbits, and orbit maintenancemaneuvers. Full-power thrusting from December 2007 through October 2008 wasused to successfully target a Mars gravity assist flyby in February 2009 thatprovided an additional ¦¤V of 2.6 km/s. Deterministic thrusting for the heliocentrictransfer to Vesta resumed in June 2009 and concluded with orbit capture at Vestaon July 16, 2011. From July 2011 through September 2012 the IPS was used totransfer to all the different science orbits at Vesta and to escape from Vesta orbit.Cruise for a rendezvous with Ceres began in August 2012 and completed in lateDecember 2014. From December 2014 through June 2016 the IPS was used fortransiting the spacecraft to the Approach phase, survey orbit, the high altitudemapping orbit (HAMO), and the low altitude mapping orbit (LAMO) with arrivalto LAMO on December 13, 2015, almost eight years after the start of deterministicthrusting to Vesta.

2067,AIAA-2016-4698,Experimental and numerical investigation of spray characteristics in a new FLOXÂ® based combustor for liquid fuels for Micro Gas Turbine Range Extender (MGT-REX),"A liquid fuel combustor based on the FLOX? gas turbine burner concept has been developed for application in a Micro Gas Turbine (MGT) Range Extender (REX) for next generation cars. The characterization of this combustor was performed at the High Pressure Optical Test rig (HIPOT) at DLR Stuttgart. Spray characteristics were measured using droplet mie scattering and phase Doppler interferometry in flames of a stable burner operation point (BOP) at a pressure, preheat temperature, global lambda (?G), and jet velocity of 3.5 bars, 300 ¡ãC, 1.45 and 120 m/s respectively. The experimental results showed long flames with deep penetration of the spray into the combustion chamber. A comprehensive data set of the spray characteristic with well-defined boundary condition was made available for CFD simulations. The CFD simulation of the two-phase flow was performed by coupling the DLR liquid phase simulation code SPRAYSIM with the commercial CFD-code ANSYS CFX-16.1. The comparison of axial and radial velocity profiles between simulation and experiment clearly showed that the turbulence model used in the numerical simulation was unable to predict the measured turbulence appropriately. The calculated and measured spray behavior in the combustion chamber showed satisfying agreement. The observed differences were mainly due to the simple 1-step global combustion model, which predicted an early onset of the heat release. The simulation showed that even though a large portion of the evaporation happened already inside the nozzle, the remaining spray droplets penetrate deep into the combustion chamber.","Experimental and numerical investigation of spray "

2069,AIAA-2016-4697,Application of Additive manufacturing in Solid and Hybrid Grain Design,"Due to the comparatively small regression rate of hybrid rocket engines based on HTPB and LOX, large grain surface areas are required for satisfying the thrust requirements imposed by sounding rocket applications. For a new 10 kN HTPB/LOX rocket engine, a star-shaped oxidizer port is selected as means for increasing the burning surface. The regression models employed during the early fuel grain design process are validated by hot-fire tests of a subscale hybrid rocket engine. In order to reduce development cost and risk during the early engine design phase these subscale grains are manufactured by filling the fuel pre-polymer into thin-walled PETG casting molds produced by additive manufacturing. This study presents the production as well as the hot-fire performance of the fuel grains. Good agreement of fuel regression between initial design and experiment is observed, demonstrating the validity of the manufacturing approach. Following the subscale tests, the grain production technology is scaled up to the fullscale grain geometry. Since it was demonstrated that AM aided grain production is feasible it is evaluated whether the same approach can be extended to solid propellant grains based on ammonium perchlorate, not only reducing development times but also extending the operational envelope of solid rocket motors.","Application of Additive Manufacturing in Solid and Hybrid "
2070,AIAA-2016-5061,Dynamic Modeling of a Mixed-Flow Afterburning Turbofan Using MATLAB/Simulink,"Variable cycle turbine engines provide many changes in the way propulsion can affect the air vehicle. The efficiency improvement is the most obvious as the turbine cycle is changed from a high performance turbojet to a high efficiency, high bypass ratio turbofan engine over various legs of the mission. In advanced air vehicle designs, an adaptive turbine engine has the potential to provide thermal management capability with a heat exchanger placed in the third stream flow path. As aircraft become more electrified, the amount of power that is pulled from the turbine engine is increasing by orders of magnitudes. All of these changes can take place at any time during the mission. Therefore, to properly model these effects a transient engine model is required. As a stepping stone to this goal, a previously developed dynamic model of a turbofan engine is being modified to include additional features. This new turbofan model will be modeled in Simulink?just as the original model was. It will include an afterburner and variable geometry nozzle and their controllers. In addition, the new model will include a supersonic inlet. These components are all considered necessary to achieve the end goal and will provide valuable insight into modeling and controls techniques for a variable cycle engine. In order to meet the requirements of this project, the engine model must be computationally stable and efficient while being easily integrated with the other aircraft subsystem models. The increased flexibility of this new turbofan engine model will provide an excellent platform for initial testing of the effects of large amounts of power extraction in the form of power take-off.","Dynamic Modeling of a Mixed-Flow Afterburning Turbofan "
2071,AIAA-2016-5062,Design Parameter Identification of the Air Supply for a Turboshaft Engine Quick-Start System,"A crucial safety requirement for intended single engine operation flights of twin-poweredhelicopters can be quick-start capable turboshaft engines. This quick-start capability of anAllison 250-C20B engine was proven by the Institute of Turbomachinery and FlightPropulsion. For this, a quick-start system based on pressurized air was designed andsuccessfully tested. The pressurized air is used to create a flow-jet with de Laval nozzles.These nozzles are integrated in the radial compressor casing of the engine. The nozzle¡¯s flowjetis impinging the trailing edge of the single radial compressor stage what leads toadditional gas generator acceleration during engine start-up. For proof of concept tests, thissystem operates with shop air at approximately 13 bar(a) air total pressure. Since anairworthy quick-start system based on 13 bar(a) air pressure supply would be too heavy andthe nozzles integrated in the radial compressor casing cannot be changed anymore, a newpressurized air supply has to be designed. First, design parameters of the quick-start systemare identified. As a result, the nozzle count and the nozzle entry total pressure are maindesign parameters. Based on these findings, a nozzle test rig was created for nozzle and airsupply performance investigations at pressure levels above 13 bar(a). This test setup wasvalidated with the shop air and analytical equations for rough performance estimations areassessed. Simultaneously, numerical simulations with ESPSS are carried out for furthervalidation purposes. Finally, recommendations are given to meet requirements of systemweight, complexity, maintainability and safety.","Design Parameter Identification of the Air Supply "

To develop a long-time working hybrid motor, the first task is to realizethe variation of fuel burning rate with oxidizer mass flow rate and grain port diameter. For the study ofthe grain port scale, a numerical simulation model is established on the convective heat transfer theory.The initial grain port diameter of three size motor are 50 mm, 109 mm, and 183 mm. series of numericalsimulations have been carried out, and the regression rate distribution along grain surface is determined.In the part of the firing test of long-time working hybrid rocket motor, the motor uses 98% hydrogenperoxide (98HP) as the oxidizer and HTPB-based grain as the fuel. Two firing tests are arranged to studyignition characteristic of the larger motor by changing ignition time sequence. Then a firing test with aworking time 50 s is conducted to check the thermal protection and nozzle erosion of hybrid rocket motorpreliminary. Finally, the working time of firing test reaches to 200 s successfully. The numerical resultsreveal that regression rate dependents not only on the oxidizer mass flux, but also on the size of the grainport, this is because the temperature profile is neither the same in non-dimensional scale, nor in physicalgeometrically motor size, there is an ¡°compromise¡± size effect of grain port on regression rate. Theexperimental results indicate that the radiative heat have contribution to regression rate, especially at acondition of low oxidizer mass flux. The chamber pressure and motor will decrease with the timeprocessing, which is caused by the effect of grain port scale and nozzle erosion.","Numerical analysis of grain port scale and firing test of long-time working hybrid motor   "

Results achieved from this approach agree qualitatively with existing numericalsimulations, and do so at a fraction of the computational time of existing fully-numericalsimulations. Increased injection pressure, lower propellant temperature, and positive in-jection swirl angle are found to be generally bene cial to engine performance. The e ectof annulus width is mixed, with an increase resulting in greater thrust but revealing ane ciency minimum.

Recent Mars missionshave used guided entry by steering bank angle to realize improved landing performance.A guidance algorithm is developed in this paper to meet the requirements of landing acapsule with low lift-to-drag ratio accurately at higher elevation sites on Mars. The strat-egy proposed is a reference trajectory planning-tracking approach with a drag accelerationfocus. The tracking algorithm for longitude control is based on model predictive control.When the vehicle is close to the target, at a certain Mach number, the guidance switchesto heading alignment guidance. Various techniques are adopted to meet the vehicle con-straints. Due to the fact that o -nominal atmospheric density and vehicle aerodynamicshave a great impact on the entry trajectory and thus large tracking errors may appear,trajectory replanning during entry is considered as a feasible option for future missions.Replanning of reference trajectory is used to null the tracking errors due to control satura-tion and disturbance e ects. The on-board replanner computes the bank reversal switchingtimes and updates the drag pro le that is to be followed by the tracker. Replanning canbe executed several times during entry. This tracking/replanning guidance reduces thelanding ellipse while keeping the computational requirements reasonable, which increasesthe feasibility of on-board implementation.

2081,AIAA-2016-5660,Detumbling Space Debris via Thruster Plume Impingement,"The increasing amount of space debris is an urgent and critical concern for space development. In order to solve the problem, this paper aims to explain the process of how to deorbit large debris such as a rocket upper stage bodies. It is anticipated that some of the space debris are rapidly spinning and tumbling on orbit, which makes it difficult for spacecrafts to capture the debris for removal. Therefore, this paper proposes a rate damping method for space debris. In concrete, this method reduces the spinning rate of the debris by plume impingement generated by thruster burns and applies torque to reduce the spinning rate of the debris. The proposed approach enables the chaser to detumble the debris without any mechanical contact, hence the risk of collision is minimized. In addition, this approach requires no additional device but some extra fuel to reduce the spin rate of the debris, which reduces the cost and makes the chaser system more reliable. In order to confirm the feasibility of the system, plume impingement torque is modeled by Navier-Stokes Direct Simulation Monte Carlo techniques and dynamics simulation was conducted. The simulation results suggested that the tumbling was suppressed by the plume impingement under a certain condition. For spindly cylinder like debris such as rocket bodies, this approach was not effective to the rotation on cylindrical axis, however rotations on the axis vertical to the cylindrical axis were reduced. Even a complex 3axis spin was suppressed to a single axis spin on yaw axis after an orbit. Moreover, by taking longer time and much fuel, the spin on the final axis could also be suppressed and the debris stopped its rotation. This approach will help the chaser to capture the rotational debris on orbit for the removal.","Detumbling Space Debris via Thruster Plume Impingement "
2082,AIAA-2016-5574,Multiphysics Modeling of Electron Collection by Bare Flexible Electrodynamic Tether in Space Debris Deorbit,"A coupled multi-physics modeling of electron collection by bare flexible electrodynamic tether isdeveloped in the dynamics of space debris deorbit. The current method assumes the tether is flexibleand deflectable and its efficiency of electron collection is variable along the tether length depending onthe tether deflection. The orbital motion limited theory is discretized and solved using the finiteelement method in the tether dynamic analysis to couple the electron collection with the tetherdeflection. The advantages of the new method are demonstrated by numerical simulations. Comparedwith a reference method in the literature, the results by the new method show that the coupling effectbetween the electron collection and tether deflection is significant, leading to the dynamic fluctuation ofelectrodynamic force acting on the tether. Although the deorbit rates predicted the two methods arealmost the same, the new method predicts a shorter stable deorbit period than the reference method. Itdemonstrates that the new method is accurate and can be used for engineering design.","Multiphysics Modeling of Electron Collection by Bare "
2083,AIAA-2016-4791,High Fidelity Large Eddy Simulation of Reacting Supercritical Fuel Jet-in-Cross-Flow using GPU acceleration,"When liquid fuel is injected into a combustion chamber, the dispersion of the fuel andthe ensuing combustion are characterized by the ambient pressure. At elevated pressures,unlike the classical liquid atomization observed at sub-critical pressures, the fuel is dis-persed by di usion-dominated mixing. Numerical simulation of fuel-air mixing and theresulting reactive ow is dependent on accurate modeling of the supercritical ow and isvery challenging. In most cases, the combination of the complex thermodynamics and thecomputational grid resolution requirements render the numerical investigations computa-tionally intractable. However, with the advent of novel heterogeneous computer architec-tures, it is possible to overcome the computational resource constraints and investigatemixing and combustion of supercritical fuels. In this paper, we study a reacting n-decaneJet-In-Cross-Flow (JICF) of air at high ambient pressure. The ow properties are com-puted using routines accelerated for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computation. Thecode assisted by GPU computation is nearly 3 times faster due to the reduction in thecost associated with the routines for thermodynamics and subgrid closures. Followed bythe dispersion of the supercritical fuel due to the interaction with the turbulent cross ow,the combustion ensues in the leeward side of the jet. The ame is anchored in the aft andspreads downstream following the mixing zone. Due to the heat release, in comparisonto the non-reactive case, the downstream turbulence is reduced. The temperature in themixing zone is correlated to the mixture fraction of the fuel and results in formation of hotspots that convect with the vortices generated by fuel-air mixing.","High Fidelity Large Eddy Simulation of Reacting"

Some fuel fluorescence images for a 10%/90% fuel staging case show a distinct difference between JP-8 and bio-derived fuel. OH PLIF results indicate that OH forms in a region more centrally-located for the JP-8 case downstream of the pilot, in its central recirculation region (CRZ). For the bio-derived Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel, however, we do not see much OH in the CRZ. The OH image structure near the dome exit is similar for the two fuels, but farther downstream the OH in the CRZ is much more apparent for the JP-8 than for the alternate fuel.

One of the problems about ducted rockets is it is difficult to control the thrust. The throttable ducted rocket (TDR) can control the fuel flow rate and then the thrust. When the second order differential of the fuel gas flow is changed, the rate of change in distance between B particles in the secondary combustor is changed. C* combustion efficiency in the secondary combustor is changed by the distance of B particles. Therefore we studied the relationship between the rate of the change in the distance B particles in the secondary combustor and the C* combustion efficiency. As a result, the C* combustion efficiency ??? is increased in the second order differential of the fuel gas flow mf?<0, and the C* combustion efficiency ¦Çc*is increased in the rate of change in the distance between B particles LB?>0.","Combustion Characteristics in the Secondary Combustor of "

A large body of literature is dedicated to various methods for e ectivelysolving the matrix equations involved. Test cases were constructed using satellitelaser ranging data for LAGEOS-1 to examine the e ects of state update methods,the treatment of the normal equations, and the matrix decomposition method.Cases are run with varying initial conditions to characterize the radius of con-vergence for each method. The Levenberg-Marquardt and Gauss-Newton stateupdate methods are compared. It is found that the Levenberg-Marquardt stateupdate method increases the radius of convergence by a factor of eighteen overthe Gauss-Newton state update method. The Lower-Upper (LU) and Choleksymatrix decomposition methods, where the least squares normal equations are ex-plicitly formed, are compared to the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and QRmatrix decomposition methods, where the least squares normal equations are notexplicitly formed. It is found that there is only a minor di erence in the radiusof convergence regardless of whether the least squares normal equations are ex-plicitly formed, or which matrix decomposition method is used. Ultimately, moredata is needed to draw generalized conclusion; however, it is clear that using theLevenberg-Marquardt state update method can greatly increase the radius of con-vergence, which is bene cial for orbit determination applications.","Comparing Radius of Convergence in Solving the"

The perturbations are compensatedby introducing its analytical solutions derived from Lagrange¡¯s planetary equations. A driftvector of aim position correction is defined to reduce the aim position bias caused by theperturbations. The purpose of optimization is to determine global optimal parking time, transfertime, drift vector and velocity increment. Firstly, global method based on interval analysis is usedto optimize the open-time Lambert problem with the perigee altitude and semi-major constraintsof transfer orbit (which is a discontinuous and non-convex problem). Then the effects of aimposition correction on fuel consumption are expressed as sufficiently large interval value andadded up to the fuel consumption interval and effectively reduce the calculation load to avoidinterval value iteration. After the entire search space is sufficiently divided and narrowed intoseveral sub spaces, a double-deck gradient-based method is utilized to obtain the minimumvelocity increment. Finally, the global optimal solution to open-time Lambert problem underfirst-order gravitational perturbations is obtained by comparisons among the optimal solutions ineach sub search space and numerical examples are accomplished to validate the optimizationalgorithm.","Global Open-time Optimization of Fuel Consumption in J2 "

An integral part of the success of these contests is aligning the incentives with the motivations of potential participants. Recognizing the importance of this alignment, we studied these motivations within the NASA Centennial Challenges where these encourage non-traditional participation and innovative solutions. Our findings show that an important difference between participating teams is the starting point of their submission. Specifically, some participate to expand upon or demonstrate their existing technology, (searching for and) using challenges as a platform for further development. The motivations of these ¡°platformers¡± are notably different than those who start the challenge de novo; technology development and non-monetary incentives are emphasized.

Structural safety has been achieved by combining safety factors with tests of material and structural components. Current aerospace design analysis methods do not directly account for the random nature of most input parameters. The result of treating parameters such as material properties, geometry, environment, and thermal loads as singly determined (deterministic) values is a design of unknown reliability, or conversely, unknown risk. Knowing the inherent risk of failure in any structural design is becoming increasingly important to both the manufacturer and the customer.

Today, multiple UAVs are simultaneously deployed by both government and civilian organizations to achieve superior coverage and more flexible response to disrupting events. Multi-UAV systems can be viewed from a system-of-system (SoS) or an intelligent swarm perspective. In this paper, we discuss multi-UAV systems from a SoS perspective. The key advantage of this approach is the flexibility afforded to study different interaction protocols and conduct trade-offs in terms of both resource allocation and function allocation to the different members in the SoS. These capabilities are at the heart of studying SoS resilience. In our illustrative scenario, multi-UAV SoS operate in an open environment in which they are susceptible to many external, systemic, or human-triggered disruptions. Therefore, it is important to be able to successfully carry out the mission while dealing with these disruptions.","Toward Development of Resilient  "

The Moballs are self-rigidized and equipped withvarious science instruments and tools (e.g. sensors, ground penetrating radar, spectrometers,imagers), robotic tools (e.g. robotic arms, drills), and aviation equipment (e.g.computational, communication and navigation systems). The Moballs are self-propelled.They can use their novel phase-changing pendulum control mechanism to initiate rolling andmove along a desired path while avoiding obstacles (e.g. steering away from larger bouldersor hopping over cracks and holes). While they do not require wind or downrolling gravityforces to propel themselves, their mechanical control system is specifically designed to takeadvantage of such forces when the conditions are favorable to move with minimal energyconsumption. When in motion, the Moballs are able to keep their center of mass in thegeometric center of the Moball to facilitate movement; alternatively, they can lower theircenter of mass, against the slope or wind, or move it to the side, to stop, or control theirspeed and trajectory. The Moballs could form a communication wireless mesh networkamong themselves and base-stations (e.g. human settlement sites, the orbiter, or the Earth)to provide collaborative and optimized exploration, environmental monitoring, navigation,positioning, computation, and relaying communication for future human exploration andsettlement missions.

In their derivation, conservation of energy and conservation of angular momentum were combining and then rearranged to a form that was then integrated. Corresponding models that were developed depict vectors in a form that relates the terms of the conservation of energy equation. Algebraic equations of motion are the goal, but the derived equations remain transcendental. The result for hyperbolic orbits is an equation with trigonometric terms which may be beneficial for some problems. It is common knowledge that orbits are conic sections, and this paper presents new models extended from those previously developed to the third dimension. These models are conical. While not improving on the known equations, the models are offered as another means of investigating elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic orbits that may lead to algebraic equations of motion.","A Three-Dimensional Approach for Two-Body Orbit Models  "

A recent study at the request of the FAA¡¯s Office of Commercial Space Transportation has examined this issue, with a particular emphasis on active and passive techniques for safely disposing of spent upper stages with minimal cost and performance impact. No single optimal technique was found, but a number of relatively low-impact solutions were found to collectively envelope most commercial vehicles and markets.

2112,AIAA-2016-5765,SDR-based Adaptive Waveform Tool with Efficient Channel Estimation for SATCOM Systems,"Satellite Communications (SATCOM) plays important roles in many applications. SAT-COM broadcasts high quality TV program, supports timely updated weather forecasts,provides accurate geolocation and direction guidance for navigation systems of both airand ground transportation. The quality and security levels of the communication systemdetermine the successful operations for these applications. Tracing back to the source,the capability and quality of wireless communications are directly related to the channelcondition. An ideal channel condition allows higher data throughput as well as low dataerror rate. And the e ort of approaching the optimal capability of given channel conditionis usually made by choosing the most suitable waveform. However, in reality, the wirelesschannel condition of a SATCOM system may vary signi cantly depending on the time andlocation of the transmitter and receiver. For example, the communication channel can bestrong when the weather is clear but weakened during heavy rain. Naturally, one wave-form does not optimize the communication in all channel conditions. Adaptive waveformselection is needed in order to serve the complex communication environments. To do that,the channel condition must be known before the waveform selection in order to approachits limit. With the help of proper channel estimation, the channel condition can be madeavailable to the transmitter and receiver. The waveform can be designed for the speci cchannel and selecting the modulation and channel coding schemes to improve communi-cation quality. High ordered modulation provides higher throughput but sacri ces errorrate. Similarly, a higher channel coding rate is capable of higher data rate communicationbut is weak in rough channel conditions. An optimal trade-o  between data rate and com-munication quality can often be found with desired quality of service for each application.An e cient in-service channel estimation method is presented in this paper. Unlike otherchannel estimations, there is no need of training sequence, meaning that the channel esti-mation is carried out during the normal data transceiving. To implement and evaluate thee ectiveness and correctness of the channel estimation algorithm and adaptive waveformdesign, a software de ned radio (SDR)-based testbed is necessary. A SDR-based testbedincludes the software GNU radio as well as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)hardware and Yagi antenna. The signal is generated and processed in the GNU radio. Thewaveform is transmitted using Yagi antenna and experiences the realistic channel condi-tion. The SDR-testbed provides a closed-loop simulation to test communications a ectsfor SATCOM. Furthermore, the adaptive waveform selection is presented and evaluated by SDR-testbed in this paper. Modulations and channels coding methods are selected withspeci c channel condition. GNU radio is originally equipped with various modulation forus to select from, and if any special modulation is needed, the system can be extendedC++ and python. We innovatively connect Matlab with GNU radio to investigate moresignal processing methods such as channel coding. The system includes coding schemes likelow-density parity-check (LDPC), Bose, Chaudhuri, and Hocquenghem (BCH), and turbocode. To summarize, an e cient channel estimation and adaptive waveform design algo-rithm are proposed to enhance performance of SATCOM system. The SDR-base testbedis provided to implement and evaluate the proposed schemes in realistic environment. Re-sults are shown to demonstrate the advantage of channel estimation and adaptive waveformselection in SATCOM communication scenarios.","SDR-based Adaptive Waveform Tool with E?cient"

Compared with conventional QAM modulation withrectangular constellation, TQAM has been shown to offer betterenergy effectiveness and better probability of error performance.Particularly, TQAM employs an equilateral triangular latticeas the building block instead of the rectangular lattice inconventional rectangular QAM. However, due to the irregularconstellation, demodulation of TQAM is more complicatedthan conventional rectangular QAM. Specifically, the decisionboundary of TQAM is quite irregular and the demodulation isvery different from rectangular QAM. In this paper, we firstobserve that the TQAM constellation can be represented astwo overlapping rectangular sublattices. Next, we propose anew efficient demodulation scheme for TQAM based on thisobservation. Specifically, received TQAM signal goes throughtwo parallel conventional rectangular QAM demodulator. Next,the decisions from both demodulators are compared to make thefinal decision. We show that this novel algorithm is very efficientand elegant compared with the original TQAM demodulator,and it takes advantage of conventional rectangular QAMdemodulator so no new hardware is required.","Ef?cient Demodulation for Triangular Quadrature"

In this paper parametrical optimization of a three-dimensional dump diffuser with aerodynamically-shaped flame tube has been carried out using a validated 3D density based steady standard k-¦Å turbulence model. Comprehensive numerical studies have been carried out to understand the coupled effects of the pre-diffuser geometry and the dump gap on the aerodynamics characteristics of dump diffusers for optimizing the flame tube geometry for getting the maximum static pressure recovery. We observed that the static pressure recovery can be increased profitably by designing a suitable pre-diffuser with aerodynamically efficient flame tube. If the head of the flame tube located at too small a distance from the pre-diffuser exit or insert in it, losses may, however, increase due to the excessive local acceleration and flow curvature. We observed that due to the area fraction blocked by the boundary layer displacement thickness the axial velocity increases up to a critical distance from the inlet section of the pre-diffuser and further it depends on the diffuser geometry and the dump gap ratio. We observed that the area blockage is one of the decisicive factors for the flow separation. We conjectured that the dump diffuser with an adjustable flame tube for getting variable dump gap may be a future viable option for warranting high performance diffusers with maximum static pressure recovery under a wide range of operating conditions. We concluded that the judicious optimization of the pre-diffuser geometry and the dump gap with aerodynamically-shaped flame tube is important for improving the overall performance of any dump diffuser.

In this regard, this paper considers the spectral coexistence of FS links withthe Fixed Satellite Services (FSS) system both in the downlink and the uplink.Out of several possible solutions to enable this coexistence, this paper deals withthe terminal-side Sidelobe (SL) suppression and Beamforming (BF) techniques atthe FSS terminal. Starting with a detailed review of the existing SL suppression,BF techniques as well as the Ka-band terminal status, first, we provide the de-tailed methodology on the employed raster scan based Direction of Arrival (DoA)estimation method. Subsequently, with the help of numerical results, we providethe performance evaluation of one SL suppression technique and one BF technique,considering a parabolic reflector with an array of auxiliary elements and the arrayof feeds, respectively. Finally, we discuss several interesting practical aspects to beconsidered while designing the proposed solutions.","Terminal-Side Interference Mitigation for Spectral"
2120,AIAA-2016-4511,Heat Transfer Analysis for Servo Valve in Hydraulic Servo Actuator of Aero Engine Vectoring Nozzle,"With the development of the vector propulsion technology, hydraulic servo actuator becomes an important component in the vectoring nozzle control system of aero engines. As already investigated by many researchers the servo valve in the hydraulic servo actuator served as a significant unit to affect the sensitivity and the accuracy of the aircraft flight attitude. Nevertheless most of these papers were found to be concentrated on topics of the control algorithm and the driver circuit and response characteristics. However, the reliability of servo valve is greatly affected by the high temperature and the high pressure, which is the working environment of hydraulic servo actuator. In order for the servo valve to work properly, this paper proposes a cooling approach, which creates a flow channel outside the servo valve. The effectiveness of this cooling approach is demonstrated by a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic simulation of the flow channel and a heat transfer analysis. Based on the simulated results and the heat transfer analysis, the effects of the entrance working medium temperature and the environment temperature and the cooling and the working medium volume flow rate on the temperature of the servo valve were studied.","Heat Transfer Analysis for Servo Valve in Hydraulic Servo "

2122,AIAA-2016-4551,Measurement of the Fragmentation Rates of Solvated Ions in Ion Electrospray Thrusters,"Ionic Liquid Ion Sources (ILIS) produce ion beams from ionic liquids and are the basisof ion electrospray propulsion. ILIS beams are typically composed of single ions as wellas ion clusters. The ion clusters are metastable and can break up inside the thruster, aphenomena referred to as fragmentation. Fragmentation within the acceleration regionof the thruster is detrimental to the propulsive e ciency. Therefore it is imperative tounderstand the physics behind the fragmentation process. Unfortunately fragmentationis not well characterized and it has been experimentally shown that di erent ionic liquidsproduce ILIS beams with di erent amounts of fragmentation. In this work, the ratesat which ion clusters break up were experimentally determined using retarding potentialanalysis. The beam energy distribution was measured using a retarding potential analyzerplaced at several distances from the source. It was found that the rates are likely constantoutside of the acceleration region. For a source voltage of 1820 V, the mean lifetime ofthe lightest ion cluster is approximately 1  s, which indicates that the solvated speciesare highly metastable. Improvements to the experimental apparatus and data analysismethods are required to increase the accuracy of the fragmentation rates. In future work,measurements close to the source will be obtained in order to better constrain the  t usedto determine the rates.","Measurement of the Fragmentation Rates of Solvated"
2123,AIAA-2016-4618,Hall2De Simulations with a First-principles Electron Transport Model Based on the Electron Cyclotron Drift Instability,"Several years of work have combined plasma measurements in a laboratory Hall thruster and r-z numerical simulations with Hall2De to isolate the spatial variation of the anomalous collision frequency needed in Ohm¡¯s law to produce the observed thruster behavior. This numerical solution is used here to test the validity of a first-principles model of the anomalous transport in these devices before such model is implemented self-consistently in r-z fluid codes like Hall2De. The first-principles model employs quasi-linear theory and is based on the hypothesis that the Electron Cyclotron Drift Instability (ECDI) excites ion acoustic turbulence that, in turn, enhances the effective collision frequency in these devices. We find that a model of the ECDI that assumes Maxwellian velocity distributions for electrons and singly-charged, main-beam, cold ions (Ti=0.07 eV) is insufficient to explain the expected variation of the anomalous collision frequency both in the interior and exterior of the acceleration channel. When warm ions (~0.5-3 eV) are accounted for, the ECDI model in the channel interior appears more promising but fails by orders of magnitude in the near plume region due to the much higher Landau damping of the ion acoustic waves there. This implies that either (a) one or more processes allow the ECDI instability to remain uninhibited by classical Landau damping or, (b) that a different instability (or instabilities) altogether, also insusceptible to Landau damping, is/are active in this region. A previous hypothesis, that convection of wave energy generated by the ECDI in the channel plays a significant role in the near plume, is not supported by the results of the simulations.","Hall2De Simulations with a First-principles Electron Transport "
2124,AIAA-2016-4619,Continuum Kinetic Study of Magnetized Sheaths for Use in Hall Thrusters,"A limiting factor in long duration space missions is the electrode lifetime for devicessuch as Hall thrusters. In order to improve thruster performance, an understanding ofplasma-material interactions is critical. Plasma sheaths form at the interface of a plasmaand a surface and high energy particles may increase the rate of surface erosion. The focusof this paper is on numerical studies of sheaths relevant to Hall thrusters. A novel versionof Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme allows for a continuum-kinetic solution of theVlasov-Poisson system of equations. This method conserves energy (in the continuous-timelimit) and provides noise-free simulations. The dynamic electric  eld is obtained using thePoisson equation and static electric and magnetic  elds for the Hall thruster con gurationare then naturally added to the Vlasov equation solver. The code includes an impactionization source and inter-species collisions. Surface e ects are neglected. Benchmarksof the solver are presented for the Weibel instability that occurs when magnetic  eld incounter-streaming populations of electrons is perturbed. Initial results of plasma sheathsusing the continuum-kinetic and multi-uid models are presented.","Continuum kinetic study of magnetized sheaths for use"
2125,AIAA-2016-4630,Discharge Chamber,"The NEXT Long-Duration Test is part of a comprehensive thruster service life assessment intended to demonstrate overall throughput capability, validate service life models, quantify wear rates as a function of time and operating condition, and identify any unknown life-limiting mechanisms. The test was voluntarily terminated in February 2014 after demonstrating 51,184 hours of high-voltage operation, 918 kg of propellant throughput, and 35.5 MN-s of total impulse. The post-test inspection of the thruster hardware began shortly afterwards with a combination of non-destructive and destructive analysis techniques, and is presently nearing completion. This paper presents relevant results of the post-test inspection for the discharge chamber as well as other miscellaneous components such as the high-voltage propellant isolators and electrical cabling. Comparison of magnetic field measurements taken during pretest and post-test inspections indicate that the field strength did not degrade, consistent with performance data obtained during the test. Inspection of discharge chamber mesh samples show a deposition coating primarily composed of grid material that is approximately 15 ¦Ìm in thickness. This thickness is well within the retention capability of the mesh and is therefore not expected to present any issues. Approximately 3.1 grams of deposition flakes were found at the bottom of the discharge chamber, composed primarily of grid material and carbon. Calculated size histograms of these flakes indicate that 99% have a maximum dimension of 200 ¦Ìm or smaller, which is significantly less than the ion optics grid gap. Larger flakes that are capable of causing a grid-to-grid short will be analyzed to determine if their formation will occur in flight or is a facility effect. The high-voltage propellant isolators as well as numerous other electrical insulators were inspected and no evidence of arcing or any other issues were found.","Post-test Inspection of NASA¡¯s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster "
2126,AIAA-2016-4631,Discharge and Neutralizer Cathodes,"The NEXT Long-Duration Test is part of a comprehensive thruster service life assessment intended to demonstrate overall throughput capability, validate service life models, quantify wear rates as a function of time and operating condition, and identify any unknown life-limiting mechanisms. The test was voluntarily terminated in February 2014 after demonstrating 51,184 hours of high-voltage operation, 918 kg of propellant throughput, and 35.5 MN-s of total impulse. The post-test inspection of the thruster hardware began shortly afterwards with a combination of non-destructive and destructive analysis techniques, and is presently nearing completion. This paper presents relevant results of the post-test inspection for both discharge and neutralizer cathodes. Discharge keeper erosion was found to be significantly reduced from what was observed in the NEXT 2 kh wear test and NSTAR Extended Life Test, providing adequate protection of vital cathode components throughout the test with ample lifetime remaining. The area of the discharge cathode orifice plate that was exposed by the keeper orifice exhibited net erosion, leading to cathode plate material building up in the cathode-keeper gap and causing a thermally-induced electrical short observed during the test. Significant erosion of the neutralizer cathode orifice was also found and is believed to be the root cause of an observed loss in flow margin. Deposition within the neutralizer keeper orifice as well as on the downstream surface was thicker than expected, potentially resulting in a facility-induced impact on the measured flow margin from plume mode. Neutralizer keeper wall erosion on the beam side was found to be significantly lower compared to the NEXT 2 kh wear test, likely due to the reduction in beam extraction diameter of the ion optics that resulted in decreased ion impingement. Results from the post-test inspection have led to some minor thruster design improvements.","Post-test Inspection of NASA¡¯s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster "

The ability to generate a quasi-neutralcollimated beam that can impart significant momentum to a distant target has a variety ofapplications, including beamed propulsion and space debris remediation. A solid-propellantfeed source for HPH, using the same technology as a Pulsed Plasma Thruster, has beendeveloped.

The ability to generate a quasi-neutral plasma beam that can stay collimated and impart significant power and momentum to a distant target in space has a variety of potential applications, including beamed propulsion and the remediation of space debris. Downstream magnetic nozzles were added to improve collimation, increase velocity, and increase on-axis thrust. These nozzles increased the flow velocity of the quasi-neutral plasma well beyond the ion sound speed. In order to increase the energy coupled into the plasma and to drive a larger diamagnetic perturbation in the beam, a second, larger radius antenna was added coaxially one wavelength downstream with the first and driven in phase with the first. This resulted in improved collimation of the plasma beam over a meter downstream, increased the diamagnetic perturbation, and increased the ion energy downstream more than 20 eV. A theoretical analysis of a steady-state Xenon propellant system with the HPH geometry was completed. At an RF input power of 300 kW, the analysis predicts a specific thrust of 93 mN/kW, mass flow rate of 6 g/sec, and specific impulse of 780 sec.","Effects of Magnetic Nozzles and a Downstream Antenna to "

We compare measured cathode temperatures to the cathode thermal simulation and show suitable agreement between the two.

A-SOFT hybrid rocket engines have controllability of both thrust and O/F without any replacement of components in the engine. This advantage is acquired by controlling oxidizer mass flow rate and effective swirl number. The purpose of this set of experiments is to confirm the continuity, monotonousness and predictability of the performances of A-SOFTs. The A-SOFT BBM showed a favorable fuel regression behavior. The fuel regression averaged along spatial direction fit the shape of regression rate function proposed before the experiments within ¡À3.5% errors, and the fuel regression rates are continuous and monotonous along swirl number and oxidizer mass flux. The O/F and thrust data also respectively fit the prediction formulas within ¡À4.2% and ¡À4.7% errors. c* efficiency is evaluated with the Isp efficiency - nozzle efficiency ratio ????/ ??? in order to compensate the pressure sensing errors caused by the centrifugal forces of swirling flows.

The combustion chamber can accommodate fuel grains of 5-12 cm in length with initial combustion port diameters of 2-20 mm. Data reduction procedures were developed and utilized to analyze preliminary motor firings of plain hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) burning in gaseous oxygen (GOX).

The improved IWR inlet that based on ICFC+ flowfield was designed firstly, and then the integration of it with variable-geometry scheme for a TBCC was presented. Feasible variable mechanism concept was proposed to change the cross-sectional area with smooth curvature transition to obtain a high total pressure recovery. Besides, the boundary layer bleed slots that placed around the splitters provided weaker shock/boundary layer interactions.

They adopt the same inlets,and the combustors and nozzles employing the same lengths and combustion organization methods.Two-dimensional numerical simulations were carried out by Fluent software. As a result, greatvariations exist between a DMSJ engine and an RBCC engine due to the integration of the built-inrocket, which reflect in many aspects that include inlet design, combustor size, fuel injection andcombustion organizations, etc. We should consider an RBCC engine as a distinct propulsion systemeven relative to a DMSJ engine, and pay sufficient attentions on it.

2143,AIAA-2016-4770,Diagnostic Investigation of Nozzle Flow Choking Time and Stage Separation Sequence of a Multi-stage Rocket,"The high-performance multi-stage rockets require greater accuracy in prediction and control of the starting and the tail off thrust transient of all stages for devising a smooth stage separation. The multistage rockets allow improved payload capability for vehicles with a high ¦¤V requirement such as launch vehicles or interplanetary spacecraft. Since each tank is discarded when empty, energy is not expended to accelerate the empty tanks, so a higher total ¦¤V is obtained. Note that keeping a burnt-out lower stage attached to the upper stage doesn't hurt until it's time to start the next stage. In fact, keeping spent lower stage attached until shortly before it's time to ignite the next upper stage can improve the total launch ¦¤V. Note that in the absence of required power level retro rockets, this sequence can invite possible re-contact between the upper stage and the lower spent stage if the upper stage is not accelerating as per prediction and/or the lower spent stage over performing with momentum. Evidently for a profitable mission and also for an efficient stage separation more precise predictions of the upper stage (Solid Rocket / Liquid Rocket) nozzle flow choking time and the tail off thrust transient of the lower spent stage are inevitable. In this paper parametric analytical studies have been carried out for examining the intrinsic flow properties pertaining to the nozzle flow choking time of high-performance solid and liquid rockets. Numerical simulations have been carried out for estimating the nozzle flow choking time of both rockets using a validated two-dimensional, axisymmetric, pressure based realizable k-¦Å turbulence model accompanied by standard wall treatment approach. We concluded that among the inflow properties, at the pre-designed conditions, the low turbulence intensity fluctuations during the starting transient period of operation is more sensitive to nozzle flow choking time of both solid and liquid rockets. We also concluded that flow choking time prediction is more significant for upper stage dual-thrust solid rocket motors.

This paper extends the use of these methods to NMP systems having intrinsic NMPzeros. By modifying ILC laws to perform pole-zero cancellation inside the unit circle, weobserve that all of the rules for sampling zeros are effective for intrinsic zeros.

2145,AIAA-2016-5643,Digital Repetitive Control of Periodic Coefficient Systems with Non-Integer Number of Times Steps per Period,"Repetitive control (RC) can in theory completely eliminate the effects of periodic disturbances of known period to a feedback control system, e.g. jitter caused by an imbalance in spacecraft momentum wheels, reaction wheels, or control moment gyros. RC can also eliminate periodic error of a feedback control system performing a periodic command, as in repetitive scanning maneuvers by an onboard instrument. In various applications, nonlinearities are important, and one may use a linear model for RC design, produced by linearizing about the desired periodic motion. This results in linear systems, but with periodic coefficients. A previous work developed RC for such systems making use of the inverse of the steady state frequency response, developed there for linear periodic coefficient systems. The error frequency components were obtained using an efficient real time moving window DFT computation. Here we develop a different approach based on the projection algorithm of adaptive control theory in order to compute the frequency components of the error. This approach has the advantage that it can handle systems with period that does not happen to be an integer number of time steps. This method is compared to the previous moving window approach with a frequency based interpolator introduced, and shown to have advantages. In linear constant coefficient systems, one generally needs to incorporate a frequency cutoff filter to robustify to high frequency model error. The additional intricacies of designing a cutoff filter for periodic systems is considered, aiming to handle the fact that for periodic coefficient systems, addressing error components below the intended cutoff can excite harmonics above the cutoff.","Digital Repetitive Control of Periodic Coefficient Systems "

2149,AIAA-2016-5109,Energy Management Strategy of Hybrid PEMFC-PV-Battery Propulsion System for Low Altitude UAVs,"As great potential to increase the endurance of low altitude electric unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the hybrid power propulsion system with fuel cells, photovoltaic panels and batteries has been proposed. The energy management strategies special for this kind of UAVs are still not well developed. This paper presents a rule-based energy management strategy (EMS) to deal with the power flow among the three power sources for extending the endurance of low altitude UAVs. The EMS considers the characteristics and state of power sources simultaneously, including conversion efficiency, service life, state of charge, state of pressure, etc. The photovoltaic panels have the highest priority to supply energy. Li-Ion battery is mainly used for peak power demand and can be recharged by the photovoltaic panels. With limited storage of hydrogen, the PEMFC generally has the lowest output priority and mainly serves at night. The EMS process, independent of complex calculation, does not require high computational cost, thus it is easy to be embedded in the onboard controller. An 18kg UAV with classical flight profile is established to verify the proposed EMS. The results show that the EMS can select reasonable power sources in terms of different power demands. Finally, the relationship between the endurance and the key parameters including date and time of takeoff, conversion efficiency of photovoltaic panels, specific energy of the battery, and hydrogen storage mass ratio are discussed.","Energy Management Strategy of Hybrid PEMFC-PV-Battery "

The energy can be used to maintain the working of the electronics in the system without any extra power. In order to store the energy, a Li-ion battery with constant voltage is employed in this study. A numerical simulation code is established to discuss the influence of the added battery on the performance of a bare tether system and the efficiency of energy harvesting on the process of de-orbiting. The battery voltage and orbit inclination is changed and the process of the de-orbiting is simulated to see the changes. The results show that the higher battery voltage is, the lower thrust, the lower energy efficiency and larger power value will be if the voltage is a reasonable value. For a bare tether system only used for de-orbiting mission, the energy efficiency keeps at an extremely low degree but the power value may be enough for electronics.","Influence and efficiency of energy harvesting on the "

The forcing functionsdue to the ignition transient phases are characterized through an ignition transient model(SPIT), widely adopted/validated for the studies of VEGA motors ignition transient duringthe development and exploitation phase of VEGA launch vehicle, for the internal ballisticsanalyses. A comparison between the frequency content of the numerical model and theone of the experimental data is carried out showing good agreement with di erent spectraldomain operators (FFT and Hilbert-Huang transform), for the  rst two ights of VEGAduring P80  rst phase of the ignition transient, where pressure experimental measurementsquality allows for the evaluation of the spectral content of the pressure in the combustionchamber. Then, the analysis of the correlation between spectral content of the pressuresignal and the one of the longitudinal acceleration at the payload interface is carried out,showing that the dynamic structural response of both P80 SRM ( rst stage), and Ze ro 23SRM (second stage) is characterized by a  rst phase directly driven by the load signature,and a second phase dominated by the structural response. Instead, Ze ro 9 (third stage)ignition transient, because of its peculiar characteristics, geometrical con guration andrapid ignition, misses this  rst phase, being the dynamic structural response all driven bythe launch vehicle and payload assembly modal response.","52nd Joint Propulsion Conference, 25 - 27 July, Salt Lake City, UT"

This profile has been shown to faithfully represent the bulk gaseousmotion in cylindrically-shaped propellant grains with circular cross sections. Thus, in thepresence of a rotational mean flowfield, our stability analysis leads to a comprehensivefrequency spectrum that encompasses both hydrodynamic and vorticoacoustic modes, withthe added benefit of pinpointing the mean flow shifted longitudinal, transverse, and mixedmodal frequencies. These are shown to agree very well with the eigenmodes predicted fromthe irrotational convective wave equation in which the mean flow is retained. As such, we findthat increasing the mean flow Mach number leads to a slight reduction in the vorticoacousticfrequencies relative to their pure acoustic countermodes in a quiescent, impermeablechamber. Similar results are also achieved when increasing the Reynolds number andchamber length, thus affirming the origin of frequency shifts observed in actual motor firings.Moreover, the behavior of the eigensolutions corresponding to the vorticoaoustic velocityfluctuations are shown to resemble quite convincingly those predicted analytically.Specifically, their depth of penetration appears to be controlled by the penetration number, adimensionless parameter that combines the effects of sidewall injection, oscillatory frequency,viscosity, and chamber radius. The compressible biglobal approach presented here may beviewed as a milestone in advancing our modeling capabilities to the extent of obviating theneed to employ Helmholtz decomposition of the unsteady motion at the forefront of theinstability analysis.","Biglobal Instability of the Compressible Taylor-Culick "

The work extends the general solution previously developed by the authors for a 3-phase spiral transfer that results in a change in the relative right ascension of the ascending node and argument of latitude of satellites in a constellation, by varying the orbital period and the J2 effect experienced by each satellite. This work improves the accuracy of the existing method by including the periodic effects of J2 in the analytical solution. Using these improved equations, a calculation of the flyover time of a given latitude can be determined, and the passes for which the target longitude is in view identified.

The purpose of this work is to develop a taxonomy withparameters that are the changes in the element sets for objects in Geosynchronous orbits.Taxonomy data points are di erences between the beginning and end values of objects'states over a given time interval  t. Two clustering methods are compared for constructingthe taxonomy. The  rst is an adaptive k-means algorithm that does not require a prioriinformation. Adaptive k-means is compared to an agglomerative clustering algorithm thatutilizes limits on cluster sizes to form distinct clusters.

In this paper, the eccentricity growth is analyzed and the potential reduction in orbital lifetime and collision risk is determined for a generic example spacecraft. Orbital lifetime and collision probability with background objects were determined for two orbit inclinations, 63.4 deg and 70 deg, over a range of LEO altitudes and compared. Results show that using a disposal orbit inclination of 63.4 deg instead of 70 deg made it possible to extend the maximum altitude with lifetime less than 25 years from 590 km to 920 km. Collision probability with the background population over 200 years was found to be reduced up to 1.5 orders of magnitude for altitudes less than approximately 1000 km. Therefore, increased use of critically inclined disposal orbits at altitudes below approximately 1000 km could potentially have a significant effect in reducing overall collision risk and future collisional debris generation in LEO.","Lifetime Reduction for LEO Critically-Inclined Disposal "

After launch, the lunar orbiter is a ectedwith various error sources including the injection error, external perturbation, navigationerror, and so on. As a result, the trans-lunar trajectory of the lunar orbiter deviated fromthe planned trajectory to the Moon. To remove this deviation, the MCC maneuvers shouldbe executed during the trans-lunar cruise. To ensure the entry into the lunar mission orbit,the error dispersion analysis is required considering error sources, especially injection errorby the launch vehicle. Moreover, it is required to design the MCC maneuver in the presenceof the injection uncertainty including trans-lunar injection (TLI) delta-V magnitude errorand pointing error. To investigate the initial error dispersion and the MCC maneuver, theMonte Carlo simulation is performed, and the results are analyzed with respect to the TLIdelta-V uncertainty.

2183,AIAA-2016-5010,Initial System Sizing,"The increasing demand for electric power on modern aircraft motivates the development of more fuel-efficient means for its generation. Solid oxide fuel cells integrated with gas turbine engines provide one possible solution to replace standalone auxiliary power units and shaft-powered electrical generators. A prototype engine-integrated fuel cell system is being designed around the AMT Olympus, a small off-the-shelf gas turbine engine that produces 230 N of thrust. A system model impelemented in NPSS is used to size the reformer, fuel cell, and other components. The results show that the integrated engine/fuel cell system can generate up to 3kW of electric power over a range of engine throttle settings, though greater characterization has been performed for approximately 200 cell channels and 1.5 kW of electrical output.","Development of an Engine-Integrated Fuel Cell Concept "
2184,AIAA-2016-4522,Fundamental Studies of Radio-Frequency Preionization for Frozen Inert Gas Plasma Magnetohydrodynamic Electrical Power Generation,"A preionization for frozen inert gas plasma MHD electrical power generation has been examined in a shock-tunnel facility to clarify the effects of Radio-Frequency (RF) electromagnetic field on the plasma fluid behavior. The heated and pressured argon gas is accelerated to supersonic and is ionized by RF electromagnetic field with an induction coil. The experimental results show that the discharge turns from E-mode to H-mode via unstable discharge with the increase of RF input power. This H-mode discharge generates stable plasma in supersonic flow. Two dimensional numerical simulations show that calculated static pressure and coil current agree with the experimental results. In the supersonic flow, the maximum point of Joule heating and ionization degree come close to the duct wall with the influence of velocity boundary layer and the plasma is attached to the wall. In the subsonic flow, on the contrary, those are apart from the duct wall with the influence of thermal boundary layer. The power factor of discharge in the supersonic flow is higher than that of discharge in the subsonic flow under the same input power conditions.","Fundamental Studies of Radio-Frequency Preionization     "
2185,AIAA-2016-4523,Numerical Simulation of Frozen Inert Gas Plasma MHD Generator with Collisional-Radiative Model,"A two-dimensional (r ?  ) numerical simulation with a collisional-radiative rate model(CR model) is conducted to examine the performance characteristics of a frozen inert gasplasma (FIP) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator using pure argon gas. Furthermore,the generator performance obtained by using the CR model is compared with the oneobtained by using a collisional rate model (C model) and a conventional rate model. Theconventional one takes account of only the processes of two-body collisional ionization andthree-body recombination. Numerical results suggest that radiative de-excitation processesof excited atoms negatively and strongly affect on performance of the FIP MHD generatorbecause the radiative de-excitation and recombination processes make a recombination rateof ions larger than the one obtained in the case of taking account of only the collisionalde-excitation and ionization processes. Moreover, an optimum load resistance to maximizethe generator performance for the CR model is higher than that for the other models. Thisis attributed to a lower electrical conductivity for CR model than the one for the othermodels.","Numerical Simulation of Frozen Inert Gas Plasma"
2186,AIAA-2016-4804,Intelligent Nodal-Based Controls Technologies for Integrated Propulsion Energy / Power / Thermal Management Systems,"Military engines today run at higher temperatures and heat is generated at higher rate than in traditional aircraft. Motivated by critical aerospace needs to develop transformative thermal management strategies, particularly for high-flux, episodic heat loads within a weight- and volume-constrained environment of aerospace vehicles, this paper provides an overview of prospective strategies and technologies that can address these challenges by exploiting the transient nature of the required cooling while also providing insights into the commensurate uncertainty quantification and nodal-based distributed control methods that will be essential to their eventual transition to future applications. The key design approach is using the new architecture both in terms of decentralized hardware and hierarchical control system software design. A hierarchical control system takes the shape of a tree in which each node operates independently, performing tasks from Supervisory Full Authority Digital Engine Control (SFADEC), commanding tasks of its subordinate nodes, sending abstracted sensations to its SFADEC, and receiving sensations from its subordinate nodes. Leaf nodes are sensors or actuators connected through high speed data bus. Hierarchical control here can be interpreted as an attempt to handle propulsion integration by decomposing them into smaller sub-problems (subsystems) and reassembling their solutions into a ""functioning"" hierarchical structure. For example the power system can be viewed as separate sub-system, the engine controllers can be further divided into several sub-systems (decentralized within), and the power system can be comprising of smaller systems. All controlled individually and collectively. Here, the software feedback control loop via databus can dynamically allocate all resources throughout the system.","Intelligent Nodal-Based Controls Technologies for "
2187,AIAA-2016-4832,Design and characterization of a 200W Hall thruster in "magnetic shielding' configuration,"One of the persistent issue for Hall thrusters (HT) is the interaction between the plasmaand the discharge channel walls. Collisions between fast ions and the ceramic walls causeerosion that can signi cantly reduce the thruster lifespan. Moreover the unfavorable vol-ume to area ratio of small and low power thrusters induces proportionally bigger losses atthe walls. This is traditionally used to explain the lower e ciency of small thrusters. Wehave designed and built a new small 200 W thruster with a magnetic con guration limitingplasma/wall interaction. We show that this magnetic  eld design, based on the \\magneticshielding"" concept does indeed reduce plasma/wall interaction for small thrusters.The discharge characteristics of this new thruster are compared with the ones of a200 W thruster of same geometry with a standard magnetic  eld topology. During theinitial testing phase, visual evidence of magnetic shielding are noted. Non-invasive LaserInduced Fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF) technique is used to compare the ion velocitydistribution functions along the center and the sides of the discharge channel as well asto compute the electric  eld of both standard and shielded thrusters. Additionally ioncurrent density is measured across the plume to assess the divergence angle and e ciencyof the thrusters.This works aims to demonstrate the viability of the magnetic shielding concept for smallHall thrusters as well as to increase the general physical understanding of this relativelynew magnetic  eld topology.","Design and characterization of a 200W Hall thruster in"

The 1st PROITERES nano-satellite with electrotermal Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPTs) was successfully launched on September 9th in 2012. The 2nd PROITERES nano-satellite has been developed since 2010. The main mission is to achieve a longer, PPT powered flight than the one of the 1st PROITERES nano-satellite. In this study, the high-power electrothermal PPT system for the 2nd PROITERES satellite is reviewed. In order to improve the thrust performance, the input energy of the PPT system was enlarged from 2.43 to 31.39 J. As a result, the PPT increased the maximum impulse bit to 2.47 mNs with a mass shot of 738¦Ìg. With 42,000 shots at a frequency of 0.5 Hz the PPT achieved a total impulse of 66.0 Ns, a thrust efficiency of 13.1% and a specific impulse of 342 s.

The electric nature of these materials leads to the capability for use in pulsed electric propulsion devices. In this work, the ablation process of an electric solid propellant during pulsed microthruster operation is investigated using a triple Langmuir probe, thrust stand and high speed video camera. Results include quantitative time-of-flight, ablation mass per pulse and impulse-per-pulse measurements. Additionally, qualitative images from the high speed video are temporally correlated to these measurements. Analyses indicate 45?1% of the ablated mass per pulse is expelled at negligible speeds relative to the effective plume exhaust velocity (1500 m/s). Further, this occurs on a time scale that is three times longer than the 0.5 ms primary discharge. This late-time ablation has been identified in other pulsed microthrusters with traditional Teflon propellant, and the results presented here indicate that electric solid propellant exhibits similar behavior.","Observation of Late-Time Ablation in Electric Solid "

2192,AIAA-2016-4947,Performance of a Hall Thruster Operating with a Radio Frequency Plasma Cathode,"Radio frequency (RF) plasma cathodes have been developed as an electron source to liberate ion and Hall thrusters from the experiencing drawbacks associated with dispenser hollow cathodes. In this paper, we evaluate the discharge characteristics and thrust performance for the combination of an anode-layer-type Hall thruster and a RF plasma cathode. Normal ion beam extraction and neutralization for the combination were experimentally confirmed. From the data obtained for the discharge current and the amplitude of the discharge current oscillation, the discharge phenomenon is not affected by the different types of cathode. On the other hand, the thrust depends to a small extent on the differences in the cathode type because of the increase and decrease in the cathode-to-ground voltage. The anode efficiency of the RF plasma cathode is comparable to that of the hollow cathode. Based on this result, the feasibility of the RF plasma cathode as an electron source for the Hall thruster in ground tests was confirmed. However, because of the high RF power consumption, the total efficiency of the RF plasma cathode is lower than that of the hollow cathode at anode mass flow rate of 2.0 mg/s and 2.9 mg/s. This result confirms that for space-related applications, it is important to improve the power consumption of RF plasma cathodes.","Performance of a Hall Thruster Operating with a Radio "

NASA GSFC Propulsion (Code 597)managed all aspects of the operation, handling logistics, preparing the procedures, andimplementing the demonstration. In addition to the partnership described above, Moog Inc.developed an LMP-103S propellant-compatible titanium rolling diaphragm flightdevelopment tank and loaned it to GSFC to act as the GPLD flight vessel.

2201,AIAA-2016-4586,"Coupling sloshing, GNC and rigid body motions during ballistic flight phases","Propellant sloshing is a major source of disturbance during a ballistic flight phase which impacts both satellites as well as upper stages. Propellant sloshing in satellite tanks gains increasing attention driven by a rising propellant demand which is needed for deorbitation of the satellites. In conclusion the propellant tanks become larger. The sloshing mass is thus increased which will have a stronger impact on the motion of the satellite. Even if the motion of the liquid is very low it is still a significant disturbance and of importance for example during missions with high point accuracy demands. Restartable upper stages carry liquid in the order of tons. Sloshing leads to an additional unbalance and a disturbance has to be controlled by the flight controller keeping the motions inside predefined bounds. Also for upper stages there is generally a need to deorbit. The consideration of ballistic flight phases with one or more engine restarts is therefore a major topic for future spaceflight. At Airbus DS these missions are simulated with our in-house tool FiPS? coupling liquid sloshing, the rigid body motion and the thruster activations driven by the flight controller. The present paper first discusses typical mission scenarios for satellites and upper stages concerning both low and high Bond number sloshing. Further on the setup of the FiPS?software is detailed. The software however lacks a final validation needed to evaluate the accuracy of the simulations compared to a realistic flight scenario. Airbus DS therefore seeks carrying out sloshing experiments on board the ISS and in parabolic flight. The paper will outline the major concepts of these experiments.","Coupling sloshing, GNC and rigid body motions during "
2202,AIAA-2016-4587,Validation of High-Resolution CFD Method for Slosh Damping Extraction of Baffled Tanks,"Determination of slosh damping is a very challenging task as there is no analytical solution. The damping physics involve the vorticity dissipation which requires the full solution of the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, previous investigations were mainly carried out by extensive experimental studies. A Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program developed at NASA MSFC was applied to extract slosh damping in a baffled tank from first principles. First, experimental data of water in a sub-scale smooth wall tank were used as the baseline validation. CFD simulation was demonstrated to be capable of accurately predicting the natural frequency and very low damping value from the smooth wall tank at different fill levels. The damping due to a ring baffle at different liquid fill levels from the barrel section and into the upper dome was then investigated to understand the slosh damping physics due to the presence of a ring baffle. error of our CFD simulation in estimating slosh damping was less than 4.8%, and the maximum error was less than 8.5%. The scalability of sub-scale baffled tank test data obtained with water was investigated using the validated CFD tool. It was found that unlike the smooth wall case, slosh damping with a baffle is almost independent of the working fluid, and it is reasonable to apply water test data to a full-scale LOX tank when the damping from the baffle is dominant. On the other hand, the smooth wall damping value must be scaled according to the Reynolds number. Experimental data and CFD results were compared with the classical and modified Miles equations for the upper domes, and the limitations of these semi-empirical equations were identified.","Validation of High-Resolution CFD Method for Slosh Damping Extraction of Baffled "

An Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is utilized to track the spraydroplets and capture the interaction between the discrete droplets and the continuous ullagephase. The spray model is coupled with the VOF model by performing particle tracking inthe ullage, removing particles from the ullage when they reach the interface, and thenadding their contributions to the liquid. A new model for calculating the droplet-ullage heatand mass transfer is developed. In this model, a droplet is allowed to warm up to thesaturation temperature corresponding to the ullage vapor pressure, after which itevaporates while remaining at the saturation temperature. The droplet model is validatedagainst the results of the MHTB spray-bar cooling experiments with 50% and 90% tank fillratios.

2208,AIAA-2016-4988,Null-Results of a Superconducting Gravity-Impulse-Generator,"It was claimed by Podkletnov and Modanese1 that a high voltage discharge through ahigh-Tc superconductor produces a gravity-like beam that can be measured using pendu-lums up to 150 m away from the apparatus. As this would be of interrest for countlessdi erent applications, among them a beamed propulsion concept,2 it has drawn a lot ofattention. Recently Poher3 and Schroeder4 designed their own experimental setup to repli-cate a similar e ect. In these experiments similar results were reported while using a highcurrent direct discharge through a high-Tc superconductor. Additionally to the emittedgravity-like  eld that was measured with an accelerometer inside a Faraday-shield in closeproximity of the superconductor, Poher also measured a mechanical impulse during thedischarge. We previously performed two small scale experiments,5 with the objective toreplicate the reported results and to gather experience. We successfully replicated themechanical impulse, but we could not generate repeatable gravity like signals. Since ourprevious results were inconclusive we decided to increase the impulse energy by at leastan order of magnitude. We achieved this by replacing our previous capacitors5 and theircharging sub-system, reaching a theoretical maximum impulse energy of up to 0.25 MJ.Our  rst objective within the present series of experiments was to exclude the most impor-tant error source, which was the emitted electromagnetic pulse that greatly inuenced thesensors and data acquisition systems. After this was achieved we investigated the causeof the mechanical impulse, which led eventually in every case to the destruction of theemitter and its support.

The design takes into account propulsive parameters with dimensional, manufacture, thermal and structural constraints. Experiments using real scale rocket models are expensive, therefore simulations are required to decrease the overall project time and cost. Solid propellant geometry and computation of its burning rate are essential for the calculation of pressure versus time and thrust versus time curves. The propellant grain geometry changes during SRM burning are also important for structural integrity and analysis. A computational tool for tracking the propagation of tridimensional interfaces and shapes is necessary for this task. In this sense, the objective of this paper is to present the developed computational tool (named RSIM) to simulate the burning surface regression during the combustion process of a solid propellant. This tool handles complex grain geometry for versatility, including multiple separate surfaces. The SRM internal ballistics simulation is based on 3D propagation, using the level set method approach. Geometrical and thermodynamic data are used as input for the computation, while simulation results of chamber pressure versus time are presented for NAWC SRM number 6.","Solid Rocket Motor Burn Simulation Considering Complex "
2211,AIAA-2016-5100,Experimental Study of Effects of Injector Configurations on Rotating Detonation Engine Performance,"Theoretically, a Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE) has higher thermal efficiency than a conventional gas turbine engine. In addition, RDE has a potential to shroten the combustuion chamber volume and makes it possible to be a simple strucuture. In order to practicalize RDEs, the optimum propellant injection configurations is necessary for steady combustion and high engine performance because it has a significant role for filling sufficient mixing layers in the combustion chamber. However, CFD analysis are usually done with premixed propellant, whereas experimental investigations are limited in terms of injector configulations. In this work, the slight difference of propagation states of detonation waves due to an increase in the number of fuel holes was not observed. Also, we shows a transiton state of detonation waves with a narrow oxidizer slit, and discuss the phenomenon.","Experimental Study of Effects of Injector Configurations on "
2212,AIAA-2016-5111,Combustion and Performance Sensitivity to Fuel Cetane Number in an Aviation Diesel Engine,"The objective of the following study is to quantify the impact of variations in fuel cetane number on the combustion and performance of multi-cylinder, turbocharged, direct-injection, diesel engines. In particular, the study focuses on engines designed for use in unmanned aerial vehicles. For this study, the combustion properties of a typical engine are evaluated based on in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, and accumulative heat release. Four different engine speed and load combinations are presented, matching the typical flight profile of an aviation diesel engine. Engine tests are conducted using six different batches of specially-formulated Jet A fuel, with cetane numbers ranging from 30 to 55. The fuel cetane number is found to have the greatest impact on low load cases, such as Ground Idle and Descent Idle. As the cetane number is decreased, the start of combustion is increasingly retarded. In many cases the pilot fuel injection does not combust until after the main fuel injection. In a small set of cases, combustion is nearly undetectable. The retarded start of combustion at low-load, low-cetane number cases leads to enhanced fuel-air mixing, and an increase in the premixed-phase combustion. This in-turn increases the peak heat release rate to high levels, and has the potential to cause engine damage or shorten the engines time before overhaul.","U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898, USA "

The low-cost mission concept utilizes a freereturn trajectory that also involves a close yby of Europa. Near Europa, a small impactorwould kinetically impact the icy moon and generate a plume, subsequently sampled by thespacecraft. A broad search algorithm is developed to construct feasible itineraries, whichconsiders Venus and Earth gravity assist sequences. High-quality solutions are then di er-entially corrected to be continuous using high- delity dynamics. The complete methodol-ogy is applicable to other outer-planet moons, notably Enceladus. The outbound VEEGAoption is found to signi cantly reduce launch C3 compared to alternate options. The char-acteristics and quality of the solutions exhibit substantial variation over the 12-year periodof Jupiter. Nevertheless, a variety of optimized results are computed with C3 as low as16.0 km2/sec2, re-entry speed well below that of the Stardust capsule, and ight times of9 to 15 years.","Trajectories for Europa Flyby Sample Return"

Speci cally, a broad search algorithm is employed to systematically locatepotentially feasible itineraries over an entire Saturn period. High-quality approximatesolutions are then optimized to be continuous using high- delity dynamics. Techniquesand software from the Europa analysis were readily adapted and able to  nd numerousmission enabling trajectories. A direct mission to Titan is possible with ight time under16 years and Earth-relative speeds below 11.0 km/sec. The VEEGA option is shownto substantially reduce launch C3, but ight times exceed 21 years. Unfortunately, anEnceladus mission requires a ight time of 25 years or more, and incurs fairly high relativespeeds.

2215,AIAA-2016-5372,R-FISST and the Data Association Problem with applications to Space Situational Awareness,In multi-object tracking the Data Association Problem (DAP) occurs when onereceives noisy measurement data and is uncertain of which object the data belongsto. This is further complicated when considering situations where the measurementcould be produced by a source of clutter or a previously unknown object.As the number of possible associations increases so does the number of possiblehypotheses. This paper considers scenarios in which generating all possiblehypotheses is computationally intractable. The authors propose using a MonteCarlo Markov Chain (MCMC) based random sampling technique called RandomizedFinite Set Statistics (R-FISST) to sample and generate the highly probablehypotheses. This allows one to avoid exhaustively generating all hypotheses andkeeps the multi-object tracking problem computationally tractable. A Space SituationalAwareness (SSA) example is used to create the mentioned scenario andillustrate the benefits of the R-FISST technique.,"AAS"
2216,AIAA-2016-5373,Novel solar sail mission concepts for high-latitude Earth and lunar observation,"This paper proposes the use of solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon system for ob-servation of the high-latitudes of the Earth and Moon. At the Earth, the high-latitudes will be crucial in answering questions concerning global climate change, monitoring space weather events and ensuring sustainable development of these fragile regions. The polar regions of the Moon, especially the South Pole, are of great scientific interest as well as a potential destination for a future permanent lunar base. The existence of families of solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon system has previously been demonstrated by the authors and is expanded in this paper by introducing additional orbit families. The paper focuses in particular on orbits that are achievable with near-term solar sail technology and that originate by maintaining the solar sail at a constant attitude with respect to the Sun such that mission operations are greatly simplified. The results provide a set of constellations for continuous observation of the high-latitudes. For example, a constellation of two solar sail L2-displaced vertical Lyapunov orbits can achieve con-tinuous observation of both the lunar South Pole and the center of the Aitken Basin at a mini-mum elevation of 15 deg, while at the Earth, a set of two, so-called ¡®clover-shaped¡¯ orbits can provide continuous coverage of one of the Earth¡¯s Poles at 20 deg minimum elevation. Transfer-ring these orbits to a higher-fidelity model, taking among others the eccentricity of the Moon into account, shows that these orbits still exist without any significant impact on their perfor-mance for high-latitude observation of the Earth and Moon.","for High-Latitude Earth and Lunar Observation "

Dromo is a specialperturbation method that o ers important advantages both for the numerical propagationand for the analytical treatment of perturbed orbital motion. When applied to linearuncertainty propagation, the proposed method is found to be less complex than non-linearmethods, both from the mathematical and the computational point of view, and overcomesfundamental limitations of linear methods based on Cartesian coordinates. A new index isproposed to assess the strength of non-linearities across the size of the uncertainty regionduring close encounters. When used in combination with the orbit condition code (OCC)proposed by the Minor Planet Center, the index can be used for predicting the evolution ofthe non-linearities in the uncertainty probability density function and to assess the domainof applicability of the proposed method. Test cases are conducted using real asteroidsexperiencing multiple close encounters.","Orbit Uncertainty Propagation Using Dromo"

Errors in ballistic coe cient estimation cause signi cant errorsin predicted satellite translational states which may lead to inaccurate orbit determinationand prediction. This paper presents an improved method for estimating ballistic coe -cients of low perigee objects from their historical two-line elements. The publicly availabletwo-line element data provide orbital ephemeris with a limited accuracy, therefore derivingaccurate ballistic coe cient requires robust estimation techniques. The method uses thedrag perturbation equation of the semi-major axis of the orbit. The method is demon-strated using a small number of objects with external ballistic coe cient reference values,and generally produces agreement within 10% of the expected value. The motivation forthis work originates from the study of space debris object characterisation.","Ballistic Coe?cient Estimation for Low Altitude"

Using a geometric solution of the Tschauner-Hempel equation, mirror ambiguousorbits, which conserve the shape and size of the true relative orbit, are proven to exist.However, deformed ambiguous orbits, which distort the shape and size of the true relativeorbit are shown to vanish due to the non-zero chief orbit eccentricity although they per-sist in Kalman  ltering simulations. This persistent phenomenon is explained through aperturbation analysis using variation of the geometric ambiguous states. Furthermore, itis shown that the inclusion of chief orbit eccentricity and nonlinearities in the  lter modelcan help resist the tendency of an extended Kalman  lter to converge to the ambiguousorbits.","Analysis of ambiguous orbits for elliptic chief relative"

All tests achieved ignition. Ignition delays were measured as a function of chamber pressure via a high-speed camera. Ignition delays were inversely proportional to chamber pressure with the strongest effect observed as the pressure was increased from atmospheric to 100 psi. All tests were run at room temperature. Ignition delays measured on the order of 30 ms for atmospheric pressure tests, while all tests conducted between 100-300 psi yielded ignition delays below 12 ms.","Investigation of Green Hypergolic Propellants for Hybrid "

2223,AIAA-2016-5387,Simulating Long Duration Deep Space Missions,"Some of the biggest hurdles in achieving the goal of sending humans to Mars and near Earth asteroids is ensuring that the human body and mind can cope with various physiological and psychological effects of long duration spaceflight which place astronauts in jeopardy for both short and long term health risks. In this paper, human factors such as mental and physical health are presented and their limitations discussed and incorporated within the examination of historical and present day Earth-based and space-based simulations to determine their ability to accurately portray a long duration deep space mission. The limitations inherent with these types of simulations support the findings that there has yet to be a simulation of a long duration deep space mission that incorporates both microgravity and the accurate long-term isolation of its crewmembers. A suggested simulation method utilizing an inflatable space habitat such as Bigelow Aerospace¡¯s B330 module with the International Space Station is discussed along with factors and variables that would need to be accounted for and controlled during such an experiment.

2225,AIAA-2016-5400,Polynesian Colonization as a Model for Human Expansion into the Solar System,"The expansion of Polynesian settlers across the major island groups of the Pacific Ocean represents a substantial human achievement, in that significant distances of open ocean were regularly crossed by hundreds or thousands of people, most likely in small groups. The environment of the Pacific Ocean is a series of habitable or marginally-habitable patches of land scattered amid large expanses of ocean, much like the solar system consists of a widespread number of planetary bodies with solid surfaces that offer various potential resources for human habitation including oxygen, water, metals, and even the ingredients for carbon-based fuel and edible material. The process of expansion into the Pacific Ocean by humans likely included multiple episodes of long-distance colonization by small groups; repeated instances of reliable, long-range voyaging between habitable locations were likely enabled by technological advances in navigation and transportation, and sustained by in-situ resource utilization. This is analogous to a possible paradigm for present-day human colonization of space that might include scouting, setup, and scientific missions by professional astronauts, as well as follow-up missions of permanent colonists. Details from historical and archaeological work examining Polynesian expansion may prove to be a source of insight into ways in which the path of permanent human expansion away from the Earth might develop. This paper proposes to identify several means of leveraging these details into insights, including a concentrated analysis of the relative land areas available to exploring groups, technology required to enable distant settlements, and the investment required to support such endeavors. This paper also compares historically-attested constructs for far-flung settlement in the Pacific Ocean, including distant trade networks, with possible future analogues in the solar system (e. g., multi-asteroid mining colonies). The relative impetus of technological, societal, and other factors in both ancient Polynesian and modern society is introduced as a primary topic for future work.","Polynesian Colonization as a Model for Human Expansion "

2229,AIAA-2016-5246,Evaluating Weapon System Maturity to Support Should Cost Initiatives,"The Government Accountability Office (GAO) publishes annual reviews of selected weapon systems; and has done so for many years. This initiative was due in part to significant growth in program costs (many times leading to a Nunn-McCurdyb breach) often due to the lack of technical maturity of proposed systems, subsystems or other elements. Similarly, Defense Acquisition guidance in Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 mandates a plan for Should Cost (SC) goals at the ¡°Milestone A¡± review to support affordability and cost control guidance. GAO has implemented a ¡°knowledge point¡± system that assesses weapon system technology maturity at each phase of the acquisition lifecycle (Milestone pre-A, A, B, etc.). While this approach provides insight into program risks, it lacks objective qualification and quantification of cost growth and schedule impacts. Quantifying the effort needed to mature technologies for weapon systems is desired to obtain more realism in weapon system cost estimates that will withstand time. To that end, we introduce an emerging technique to evaluate systems and their technology readiness using system readiness levels (SRLs). The method supports the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) better buying power initiatives (1.0, 2.0 & 3.0) to have confidence in meeting development and reduction in total ownership cost objectives.

The model provides a method togenerate the information needed to create short and long term plans. This information is the basis to tailorpackages for industry partners, existing clients, potential customers, go-fund-me campaigns, tax incentiveprograms, and any other funds sources.

In order to effectively design the CH4/O2 liquid rocket engines, the fundamental studies of the combustion characteristics of CH4/O2 at various phases are needed. In the present study, the combustion charateristics of gaseous CH4/O2 coaxial jets in a single-element combustor are investigated, comparing the results with the gaseous H2/O2 coaxial jets. It is found that stably attached flames are observed for most fuel-rich condition (based on the injected amounts of fuel and oxygen) due to the enhanced chamber pressure that results in suppressed dissociation and enhanced radiation absorption, while they are observed only at low amounts of injected O2 for fuel-lean condition. Combustion of CH4/O2 coaxial jets seems to be acceptable for practical application since the fuel-rich CH4/O2 flames still show very stabilized and intensified burning, though the combustion stability limits under fuel-lean condition are reduced compared with the H2/O2 flames.","Comparative Studies of Combustion Characteristics of "

While events such as the Chelyabinsk incident temporarily grab international attention, they fail to effectively galvanize the public and policy makers to action. Numerous potential solutions have already been proposed and some concepts are even being tested. However, many of these potential solutions are incredibly expensive, require very early hazard detection, or are politically unpalatable. These are just few elements of the larger problem of planetary defense. To address these challenges, the Roadmap for EArth Defense Initiatives (READI) Team Project developed concepts in multiple areas of focus from global collaboration and education to detection and deflection engineering problems by analyzing the current state of planetary defense concepts. The project expanded ideas into less discussed realms and contributed to the overall discussion with realistic and implementable solutions for short warning time threats. The READI Team Project is highly international, interdisciplinary, and intercultural given a large number of members participated from around the world and from numerous academic backgrounds. The project was undertaken as part of a highly intensive, nine week space studies program. This meant that, as well as tackling one of humanity's greatest problems, there were substantial time constraints and the process of managing this project was very challenging. This paper focuses on how this interdisciplinary project was successfully accomplished using the Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) as a systems engineering approach. We show how the team analyzed each of the elements of planetary defense to cover a wide range of requirements, and how the IPPD method allowed us to generate and propose realistic and feasible solutions to cosmic threats. We also provide recommendations for managing such complex project in a short time given challenging conditions, resulting in a collaborative effort to achieve successful technical results through effective management of the project.","Modelling IPPD for an Interdisciplinary "

Energy conversionand utilization from residential food waste, out of the commonly sourcedbiomass feedstock, including wood, animal waste, and agricultural products,are investigated. Accurate characterization of the cleaning process in acyclone separator for a suitable micro channel reactor, where themethanation reaction takes place, is attempted. For simplicity, lowmaintenance cost and relevance to industrial applications, three commoncyclone configurations, namely the 1D2D, 2D2D and 1D3D, are accessed.Comparative analyses of each of the three configurations, including theprediction of particle separation efficiency, particle size distribution, cut-sizediameterand pressure drop, are carried out. The 2D2D cyclone provides thebest performance with the smallest cut-size-diameter for flow rates of 0.1 to1m/s, while the 1D2D has the smallest pressure drop.","Optimal Technique for Separation of Particle-rich "

2246,AIAA-2016-4518,Stability Analysis of Spacecraft Power Systems and Power Processing Units,"Spacecraft power systems typically have two different types of power sources such as a battery whichbehaves as a voltage source, and a solar array that behaves as a current source. Power systems have variouspayloads that have different input filters with resistive, capacitive and inductive loads, resulting incomplicated input impedance characteristics. The combination of various payloads¡¯ input impedancecharacteristics together with a complex main bus control circuit often creates non-standard shapes of phaseand gain curves in the control loop Bode plots, e.g. multiple zero-dB crossings of gain curves and multiple -180 degree crossings of phase curves. Therefore, in some cases, the conventional method of measuring phasemargin and gain margin from Bode plots can lead to an inaccurate representation of the system stability andcause integrated system oscillations. It is demonstrated that a Nyquist plot method is required to determineaccurate stability margins for several cases of non-standard shape Bode plots.","Stability Analysis of Spacecraft Power Systems and Power "

The inuence of electrical conductivity of swirl vanes(conductor or insulator) on the MHD ow and the generator performance is investigatedespecially. The MHD simulation is performed, including swirl vanes into computational do-main for the  rst time. The results show that electron temperature in the region betweenconductive vanes is higher than that between insulator vanes. However, when working gasreaches to the region with a ring-shaped electrode, electron temperature drops sharplybecause of a lack of electric  eld, and the difference in electron temperature observed inthe region between vanes between the cases of conductive and insulator vanes disappears.This results in almost the same performance in an MHD channel between conductive andinsulator vanes.","Numerical Analysis of Non-equilibrium Disk"

2253,AIAA-2016-4833,Performance Evaluation of the T-40 Low-Power Hall Current Thruster,"The performance of the Aerojet Rocketdyne T-40 low-power Hall current thruster(HCT) is experimentally characterized with both xenon and krypton propellant. The T-40HCT is operated at a constant anode flow rate of 11.7 sccm (1.14 mg/s Xe, 0.73 mg/s Kr),discharge voltages of 150 V ¨C 300 V, and discharge powers of 75 W - 250 W. The nominalfacility operating pressure during thruster firings is 1.2 ¡Á 10-6 Torr and 9.9 ¡Á 10-7 Torr,corrected for xenon and krypton, respectively. The T-40 is operated with an oversized 10-Acathode due to unavailability of the nominal 3-A cathode. Measurements are taken of thethrust, anode specific impulse, and anode efficiency as well as the plume divergence halfangle,ion beam current, and most-probable ion voltage as a function of discharge power,discharge voltage, and propellant. For operation with xenon, the thrust, anode specificimpulse, and anode efficiency of the T-40 HCT vary between 7 mN - 14 mN, 638 s ¨C 1274 s,and 19% ¨C 37%, respectively, as the discharge power increases from 116 W to 243 W. Forkrypton operation, these values vary between 1.2 mN ¨C 8.8 mN, 168 s ¨C 1242 s, and 1% ¨C37%, respectively, as the discharge power increases from 77 W to 145 W. At comparabledischarge power levels, the thrust of the krypton-operated T-40 HCT is 15% lower onaverage as compared to xenon operation. However, the anode specific impulse and anodeefficiency for operation at a discharge power of 150 W is 38% and 35% higher, respectively,for krypton operation. Despite potential deleterious effects due to the oversized cathode,these performance measurements for the T-40 HCT with both xenon and krypton surpass orequal existing low-power xenon HCT options at comparable discharge power levels, thusmaking the T-40 an attractive option for low-power HCT systems.","Current Thruster "

The front loaded L2F blade profile is considered along with a variation of the blade contoured near the endwall. The L2F blade has excellent midspan performance, but large pitch spacing, stagger angle, and pressure gradients produce strong secondary vortex structures at the endwall. Previous studies have shown correlations between total pressure loss and the turbulent structures within the passage. Locations of peak deformation work align with regions of high total pressure loss. In the present study deformation work is compared with total pressure loss and total pressure gradient. In addition to deformation work, convective total pressure transport along a streamline is presented and correlates well with local total pressure gradient. This comparison has resulted in improved understanding of loss production and flow characterization through a highly loaded low pressure turbine passage.","Secondary Loss Production Mechanisms in a Low Pressure "
2256,AIAA-2016-4639,Gas Turbine Transient Response to Subsystem Architecture Secondary Power Off-Takes,"Regulations and economic incentives have driven the aerospace industry towards reduc-ing fuel burn, emissions, and noise for commercial aircraft over the last several decadesand this trend will not change in the foreseeable future. Many aircraft design changes havebeen proposed to meet the more demanding requirements. Switching from conventionalpneumatic subsystem architectures to more-electric subsystem architectures is one of theproposed aircraft design changes to meet the requirements. However, changing subsystemsupply from pneumatic to electric introduces a change in the load on the power supplyinggas turbine spool. Consequently, the change in the load affects a gas turbine's transientresponse. In the literature the focus has been on aircraft sizing and steady state perfor-mance with more electric subsystem architectures but not on the effects of the subsystemarchitecture changes on the gas turbine transient response. Therefore, this work aims tostudy the changes in transient performance due to the changes in subsystem architecture.The  rst step was to size a gas turbine for the conventional and bleedless subsystemarchitectures when one engine was inoperable. After the sizing process, the steady statemodels were converted into dynamic models by including only spool dynamics for eachspool in the gas turbines. In parallel the customer bleed or power extraction demandfrom the gas turbines were calculated for the conventional and more electric subsystemarchitectures. Then, the transient response to these subsystem demands were simulatedduring climb. Transient performance evaluation focused on net thrust and stall marginconsumption. Customer bleed extraction increased the compressor stall margin in linewith literature and reduced net thrust signi cantly more than customer power extraction.","Gas Turbine Transient Response to Subsystem"

Current researches imply that the better control effect is, the moreorder of the flow field will be. However, there is no proper quantitative indicator to measurethe degree of order of the unsteady flow field at present. In this paper, the effect of thedifferent control parameters for vibration wall on total pressure loss was studied by thelarge eddy simulation CFD method, and the maximum Lyapunov exponent was introducedto quantitatively analyze the order degree of the unsteady flow field. Results show that thebest control effect will be achieved when the vibration frequency reaches the separationvortex frequency, with the amplitude 0.1L. The maximum Lyapunov exponents of timeseries of pressure in uncontrolled flow field are positive while negative in controlled flowfield, indicating that the vibration wall is able to transfer the flow field from disordered oneto ordered one.","Application of the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent to Analyze "

Using the linear relationship between temperature and the proton resonant frequency(PRF), MRT can accurately and non-invasively measure temperature in turbulent flows throughcomplex geometries with exceptional access, even for flows that would be obscured to conventionaldiagnostic techniques. Accurate flow temperature measurements in complex passages is critical forapplications in several fields, including in vivo body temperature measurements during thermaltherapies and film cooling passages in gas turbine blades. When combined with Magnetic ResonanceVelocimetry (MRV), MRT provides an accurate, non-invasive and robust flow diagnostic methodcapable of enabling increased understanding of thermal-fluid phenomena. The flow configurationunder investigation in this study is a jet in a cross-flow and consists of two separate cases.

For the inverted case, the temperatures of the jet and bulk flow are reversed. Theresults of this study are compared to previous experimental work to further validate MRT as atemperature measurement technique and provide detailed data sets for comparisons with numericalsimulations.

The present work shows detailed information of flow phenomena using ParticleImage Velocimetry (PIV) in a single row narrow impingement channel. PIV measurementswere taken at a plane normal to the target wall along the jet centerline for five jets. TheReynolds number based on jet diameter was 15,000.

2263,AIAA-2016-4851,Preliminary Investigation of an Oblique Jet Impingement Cooling on a CMC Rough Surface,"It is expected that with the potential introduction of Ceramic- Matrix- Composites into the gas turbine hot section, cooling methodologies will still be required. The surface of the CMC varies significantly from traditional super-alloys used in modern engines, with large levels of roughness, and a significant waviness. These complex features will impact the behavior of the near wall flows, and effect the heat transfer rates both internal and external to the blade. Existing design tools should be updated in order to account for these effects. As a preliminary investigation into these effects, an obliquely impinging circular jet on CMC surface is studied experimentally and numerically to find the effect of surface features on heat transfers rates. In this study, an oblique angle of 45? jet to plate distance of 6.5 jet diameters and two Reynolds numbers 11,000 and 23,000 were selected. Experimental results, showed an enhancement in area averaged heat transfer levels between 20- 50% for a Reynolds number 11,000 and 23,000 respectively. Also, the secondary peak shifts towards the stagnation region for different orientation of impingement on the CMC surface. The effect of local roughness on heat transfer rates was also assessed. Numerical results were benchmarked against experimental results, using v2f turbulence model. The computational result, showed that the local and average Nusselt number for the smooth surface impingement was estimated very close to experimental values and the error was in the range of 17- 30%. In case of impingement over the CMC surface, this model predicted the heat transfer rates close to exact values in the stagnation region and produced local Nusselt number trends following the experimental results.","Preliminary Investigation of an Oblique Jet Impingement "

2265,AIAA-2016-4985,High Suction Performance Pumps with Large Inlet Blade Angles and an Integrated Stability Control Device,"High suction performance pumps are able to operate stably at very low inlet pressures with significant cavitation in the domain. Typically these pumps are required to have small inlet blade angles in order to limit the adverse effects of backflow at the inducer leading edge. The implementation of a stability control device (SCD) can allow inducers with larger inlet blade angles to suppress backflow and operate at the low flow coefficients required for high suction performance pumps. This allows inducers with larger inlet blade angles to be included in the design space for high suction performance pumps. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to investigate this new design space by analyzing the performance of inducers with inlet blade angles of 7?, 9?, and 11?. The flow coefficient for these cases was ?=0.07. The same inducers were also analyzed at the same flow coefficient with a modified SCD geometry that limited the mass flow rate through the SCD. It was observed that both the overall stability and suction performance are very sensitive to the mass flow rate through the SCD channel.","High Suction Performance Pumps with Large Inlet Blade "
2266,AIAA-2016-4986,Characterization of Rotating Cavitation in a Four Bladed Inducer,"This work aims to characterize the dynamic behavior of a four bladed inducer and clarify the physical mechanism that leads to theonset of rotating cavitation. The inducer under consideration is representative of a low-pressure liquid oxygen pump (LPOP) inducerof modern design and incorporates several standard design features used in rocket turbopumps to suppress rotating cavitation. Themechanism is characterized based on a combination of two-phase numerical simulations and inducer experiments. Experimentalmeasurements demonstrate a supersynchronous rotating cavity in the periphery of the inducer inlet at frequencies between 1.2 and1.6 times rotor frequency and a synchronous 2nd spatial harmonic pattern associated with alternate blade cavitation. The analysisindicates a causal link between alternate blade cavitation and rotating cavitation, with a distinct cut-on cut-off behavior. Numericalcalculations and high-speed videos elucidate the mechanism of breakdown of alternate blade cavitation and the formation of rotatingcavitation. The present work suggests that rotating cavitation is caused by the coupling of the cavities on adjacent blades duringalternate blade cavitation. Due to the nearly tangential flow, the vortex lines from one of the non-cavitating blades wrap around theblade leading edge of the adjacent blade, which yields a drop in static pressure and cavity formation. The tip vortex cavity interactionwith the leading edge of the blade leads to sheet cavity breakdown with periodic growth and collapse of cavities, creating theapparent super-synchronous rotation of the cavitating region.","C.

EPMA and XRD analyses, roughness and HB measurements havebeen carried out for test specimens after each test. It became clear that minute amounts ofsulfur was detected. However, it does not affect the hardness. Then, the effect of coking islarger than that of sulfur when bio-ethanol. Furthermore, more coking was observed whenbio-ethanol came in contact with Inconel because of the metal dusting effect. From theevaluation of heat transfer coefficient, we can understand that approximately 500K of bioethanoltemperature is an upper limit of characteristic the change of heat transfer coefficient.From the engine system calculation taking into account the effect of coking, we found thatthe driving factor of the number of times of reusability was coking, not the material cyclefatigue if Inconel is used at the cooling chamber outer cylinder.","Material Compatibility of Bio-Ethanol Fuel with "

2271,AIAA-2016-4778,A Hybrid Solid/Gas Core Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engine for Future Solar System Exploration,"The goal of this work was to investigate a type of nuclear thermal rocket that has many of the advantages of open-cycle gas core rockets, while alleviating some of the drawbacks. Chemical rockets are limited in specific impulse due to the high molecular weight of the exhaust products, and the operating temperature. Solid-core nuclear thermal rockets can have much lower molecular weight exhaust, but have operating temperatures no higher than ~3000K due to the material limitations of the fuel. One possible solution is to use a gaseous fuel that can run at indefinitely high temperatures, but controlling the reactivity and containing the fuel has historically proven to be challenging. The current work focuses on a hybrid-fuel reactor with solid and gaseous fuel. The reactor cavity is surrounded by solid fuel which provides upwards of 50% of reactor power. This reduces the amount of gaseous fuel, which resulted in smaller reactivity fluctuations while maintaining a high performance (with specific impulses still around 1600 to 2000 Sec.). Reactor designs were evaluated with MCNP6, and the specific impulse was determined with NASA¡¯s CEA code. Hypothetical scenarios for conjunction-class Mars missions were compared to similar missions using chemical and conventional nuclear thermal propulsion.","A Hybrid Solid/Gas Core Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engine "
2272,AIAA-2016-4885,Nuclear Thermal Rocket - Arc Jet Integrated System Model,"In the post-shuttle era, space exploration is moving into a new regime. Commercial space flight is in development and is planned to take on much of the low earth orbit space flight missions. With the development of a heavy lift launch vehicle, the Space Launch, System, NASA has become focused on deep space exploration. Exploration into deep space has traditionally been done with robotic probes. More ambitious missions such as manned missions to asteroids and Mars will require significant technology development. Propulsion system performance is tied to the achievability of these missions and the requirements of other developing technologies that will be required. Nuclear thermal propulsion offers a significant improvement over chemical propulsion while still achieving high levels of thrust. Opportunities exist; however, to build upon what would be considered a standard nuclear thermal engine to attain improved performance, thus further enabling deep space missions. This paper discuss the modeling of a nuclear thermal system integrated with an arc jet to further augment performance. The performance predictions and systems impacts are discussed.","Nuclear Thermal Rocket ¨C Arc Jet Integrated System Model "
2273,AIAA-2016-4886,Three-Dimensional Analysis of a Hydrogen Containment Process For Nuclear Thermal Engine Ground Testing,"an oxygen-rich burner and a tubular heat exchanger. The burner burns off the majority of the hydrogen, and the remaining hydrogen is removed in the tubular heat exchanger through the species recombination mechanism. A multi-dimensional, pressure-based multiphase computational fluid dynamics methodology was used to conceptually sizing the oxygen-rich burner, while a one-dimensional thermal analysis methodology was used to conceptually sizing the heat exchanger. Subsequently, a steady-state operation of the entire hydrogen containment process, from pressure vessel, through nozzle, diffuser, burner and heat exchanger, was simulated numerically, with the afore-mentioned computational fluid dynamics methodology. The computational results show that 99% of hydrogen reduction is achieved at the end of the burner, and the rest of the hydrogen is removed to a trivial level in the heat exchanger. The computed flammability at the exit of the heat exchanger is less than the lower flammability limit, confirming the hydrogen containment capability of the proposed process.","A Hydrogen Containment Process "

One of the most advanced launch vehicle propulsion systems, such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), used hydrogen and oxygen and had a delivered specific impulse of 453 seconds. In the early days of the space program, other propellants (or so called metapropellants) were suggested, including atomic hydrogen and liquid ozone. Theoretical and experimental studies of atomic hydrogen and ozone were conducted beginning in the late 1940s. This propellant research may have provided screenwriters with the idea of an atomic hydrogen-ozone rocket engine in the 1950 movie, Rocketship X-M. This paper presents analyses showing that an atomic hydrogen-ozone rocket engine could produce a specific impulse over a wide range of specific impulse values reaching as high as 1,600 s. A series of single stage and multistage rocket vehicle analyses were conducted to find the minimum specific impulse needed to conduct high energy round trip lunar missions.","Propulsion Estimates for High Energy Lunar Missions "

The objective was to gain a better understanding of the physical phenomenainside a pressurized flametube combustion chamber under acoustically isolated conditions.A nine-point swirl venturi lean direct injection (SV-LDI) geometry was evaluated at inletpressures up to 2,413 kPa and non-vitiated air temperatures up to 828 K. The equivalenceratio was varied to obtain adiabatic flame temperatures between 1388 K and 1905 K.Dynamic pressure measurements were taken upstream of the SV-LDI, in the combustionzone and downstream of the exit nozzle. The measurements showed that combustiondynamics were fairly small when the fuel was distributed uniformly and mostly due to fluiddynamics effects. Dynamic pressure fluctuations larger than 40 kPa at low frequencies weremeasured at 653 K inlet temperature and 1117 kPa inlet pressure when fuel was shifted andthe pilot fuel injector equivalence ratio was increased to 0.72.","Experimental Combustion Dynamics Behavior Of A Multi-"

These advantages could be more easily exploited in applications that require moderate performances like, among others, sounding rockets. Classical sounding rockets use solid propulsion due to its simplicity and good performances. However, increased safety restrictions for production, transportation and testing, lower availability and environmental concerns have made the use of solid sounding rockets more difficult than in the past. Hybrids can provide a green replacement for solids and, in fact, are becoming more and more popular between amateur and student organizations; this trend culminated by the European altitude record achieved last year by Delft University. In particular, the use of nitrous oxide as oxidizer allows the design of a green self-pressurizing propulsion system that is almost as simple as a solid but much more tolerant to manufacturing and handling issues. Thrust termination and throttling are potential added feature of hybrid motors.","Numerical Optimization of Hybrid Sounding Rockets through "

A manned taxi spacecraft rendezvous with this cycler spacecraft while thecycler is in a hyperbolic orbit about the planet. This can save on fuel costs over the life-time of the campaign since heavy life support and radiation shielding does not need to belifted for each mission. Several previous studies have discovered feasible cycler trajecto-ries for many launch opportunities while others have looked at the guidance and systemsafety aspects of hyperbolic rendezvous. However, no study to this date has examined theimplications of di erent cycler architectures and launch dates on the rendezvous maneu-ver.

Anumber of proposed solutions to the debris problem involve dedicated debris removalsatellites to reposition or de-orbit uncontrolled objects, using grappling devices, tethers, orelectrostatic forces. In order to conduct proximity operations necessary to rendezvous andde-orbit space debris, accurate relative navigation is required. The space-based stereo-visionmeasurement is an effective solution for relative navigation. However, when tracking spacedebris with large separation distances, the relative state estimate can become less accurate.This work uses Lawden¡¯s equations as the relative dynamical model for the ellipticalreference orbit and analyzes the uncertainty of the relative state estimate. An innovativeapproach is proposed to compute the relative position PDF by using Monte Carlo samplesand the Gaussian mixture model method. The initial relative velocity PDF is computed usingthe unscented transform with the PDFs for the first two initial positions and linearizedrelative dynamics.

On the other hand, it has greater uncertainties in thedynamical system than the conventional spacecraft. Therefore, the solar sail trajectoryshould be designed with enough robustness against the disturbances. Similarly to the dutycycle in low-thrust trajectory design, a typical method designs a nominal trajectory with anunderestimated acceleration model, and controls the solar sail spacecraft to follow the nom-inal trajectory by shedding the excess thrust in the actual operation. However, this methodmight be conservative or not robust enough to disturbances. To derive the robust trajec-tory, this paper introduces Stochastic Di erential Dynamic Programming, which solvesthe quadratically expanded Bellman equation for the stochastic-optimal control problem.Numerical examples show that the proposed trajectories have more robustness to distur-bances, and the expected value of performance becomes better.","Robust-Optimal Trajectory Design against"

The concept is second generation swirl-venturi lean directinjection (SV-LDI). LDI is a lean-burn combustion concept in which the fuel is injecteddirectly into the ame zone. All three variations were based on the baseline 9-point SV-LDI con guration. The three second generation SV-LDI variations are called the 5-recesscon guration, the at dome con guration, and the 9-recess con guration. These threecon gurations were tested in a NASA Glenn Research Center medium pressure ametube.All three second generation variations had better low power operability than the baseline 9-point con guration. All three also had low NOx emissions, with the 5-recess con gurationgenerally having slightly lower NOx than the at dome or 9-recess con gurations. Dueto the limitations of the ametube that prevented testing at pressures above 20 atm,correlation equations were developed for the at dome and 9-recess con gurations so thatthe landing-takeo  NOx emissions could be estimated. The 9-recess landing-takeo  NOxemissions are estimated to be 85% below the CAEP/6 standards, meeting the project goalof 80% reduction.","A comparison of three second-generation swirl-venturi"

In the present study, a research model combustor that was used in a previous study has been modified for the combustion experiments of CH4/O2 coaxial jets at elevated pressure, and the combustion characteristics of gaseous CH4/O2 coaxial jet flames with variation of internal pressure are experimentally investigated as a preliminary step for subsequent studies of injection at very low temperature or using liquid O2 for CH4/O2 bipropellants. Results show that for fuel-rich condition flame stability limits are extended and flame intensity is enhanced with increasing chamber pressure, due to the enhanced radiation absorption and suppressed dissociation.","Studies on Flame Behaviors of GCH4/GO2 Coaxial Jets in a "

Waveriders have significant performance advantages in maximizing lift and the lift-to-drag ratio compared to other generic hypersonic vehicles. The disadvantage is that waveriders are, in principle, designed for a specific operating condition with respect to Mach number and shock shape. The general construction method is to select an imaginary generating body with a known steady-state shock shape, define the waverider leading edge along the shock and below a symmetry plane, and then trace stream surfaces from the leading edge to create the resulting vehicle geometry. If the Mach number or angle of attack are varied, the vehicle operates ¡°off design¡± and the performance advantages are degraded. The present work describes a subset of waverider geometry in which a parametric investigation revealed that the total area of the stream surface is approximately constant across a range of Mach numbers, despite variation in the stream surface curvature for a fixed leading edge.

Assessment of the baselinenon-commercial architecture shows the required launch rate of the Space Launch System exceedsthe Evolvable Mars Campaign ground rule. Using commercial launch providers to perform theresupply missions reduces the required launch rate of the Space Launch System to bring it morein line with the established ground rule. Analysis show single provider commercial resupply wouldrequire launch rates no greater than twelve per year without aggregation and no greater than fivelaunches per year with aggregation.

We have used data re-turned by the five-probe THEMIS/ARTEMIS constella-tion to quantify the compression ratio and compression speed improvements over a variety of data types (e.g., time-series and particle data). Our approach results in a 38% improvement in compression ratio and up to a three-fold improvement in compression throughput and energy efficiency.

First, the team compared three different solar-power options against a fission power system concept for a sub-scale, uncrewed demonstration mission. This ¡°pathfinder¡± design utilized a 4.5 meter diameter lander. Its primary mission would be to demonstrate Mars entry, descent, and landing techniques. Once on the Martian surface, the lander¡¯s ISRU payload would demonstrate liquid oxygen propellant production from atmospheric resources. For the purpose of this exercise, location was assumed to be at the Martian equator. The three solar concepts considered included a system that only operated during daylight hours (at roughly half the daily propellant production rate of a round-the-clock fission design), a battery-augmented system that operated through the night (matching the fission concept¡¯s propellant production rate), and a system that operated only during daylight, but at a higher rate (again, matching the fission concept¡¯s propellant production rate). Including 30% mass growth allowance, total payload masses for the three solar concepts ranged from 1,128 to 2,425 kg, versus the 2,751 kg fission power scheme. However, solar power masses increase as landing sites are selected further from the equator, making landing site selection a key driver in the final power system decision. The team also noted that detailed reliability analysis should be performed on daytime-only solar power schemes to assess potential issues with frequent ISRU system on/off cycling.","Solar Versus Fission Surface Power for Mars "
2307,AIAA-2016-5561,Streamlining the Design Tradespace for Earth Imaging Constellations,"Distributed Spacecraft Missions (DSMs) are gaining momentum in theirapplication to Earth Observation (EO) missions owing to their unique ability to increaseobservation sampling in spatial, spectral, angular and temporal dimensions simultaneously.DSM design includes a much larger number of variables than its monolithic counterpart,therefore, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been often used for preliminarymission concept designs, to understand the trade-offs and interdependencies among thevariables. MBSE models are complex because the various objectives a DSM is expected toachieve are almost always conflicting, non-linear and rarely analytical. NASA GoddardSpace Flight Center is developing a pre-Phase A tool called Tradespace Analysis Tool forConstellations (TAT-C) to initiate constellation mission design. The tool will allow users toexplore the tradespace between various performance, cost and risk metrics (as a function oftheir science mission) and select Pareto optimal architectures that meet their requirements.This paper focuses on the tradespace search and how it can be streamlined by combiningphysical rules, as well as well-designed orbit and coverage computations, thus yieldingsignificant speed-ups. Two use cases are shown as representative examples of the utility ofTAT-C generated trades, and results are preliminarily validated against AGI¡¯s Systems ToolKit.","Streamlining the Design Tradespace for  "

Based on decades of practical experience with rocket-only expendable launch vehicles, currenttechnology is operated close to theoretical limits. Scramjets have an advantage over rocket propulsion interms of a significantly higher specific impulse. Other benefits of airbreathing propulsion for access-to-spaceare increased launch flexibility and the possibility of reusable aircraft-like operations. This article describesthe use of a three-stage rocket-scramjet-rocket system for transporting payloads of the order of 100 kg to aSun Synchronous Orbit. The reusable second stage is based on a winged-cone vehicle and is powered byhydrogen fueled scramjets. Analysis of the complete three-stage system was performed based around a fullytrimmed trajectory simulation of the second stage. The scramjet powered second stage accelerated fromMach 6.0 to Mach 9.3 with an average net specific impulse of 923 seconds. As a result, the overall systemshowed a payload mass fraction of 1.26% to Sun Synchronous orbit, which is significantly higher thanexpendable rocket based systems of this scale.","Dedicated Launch of Small Satellites using Scramjets "

2312,AIAA-2016-5611,From Ground Testing to Space Flight,"Once a biological experiment is accepted for execution onboard the International Space Station, the specific scientific requirements are manifested into suitable hardware, the Experiment Unique Equipment (EUE). The Gravi2 EUE was developed by AIRBUS (Germany) to support germination and growth of lentil seeds inside an Experiment Container (EC), in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS is located in the Columbus Module and operated by N-USOC (Norwegian User Support and Operations Center). A new and very important feature of the Gravi2 EUE (compared to the Gravi1 EUE) was the ability to perform automated fixation of the samples while still inside the EMCS, preserving the ¡°in situ¡± cellular biochemical reactions. The Gravi2 experiment was successfully executed in May 2014 and during the two experiment runs the seeds were exposed to four different g-stimulations (0.01g, 1g, and 2g for 5 min and 2g for 15 min). The cellular responses to these g-stimulations were preserved by automatic fixation at the end of each experiment run. Gravi2 integration products and hardware performance tests were all developed and executed by the N-USOC team, in cooperation with the science and engineering teams. The test program was outlined in accordance to the ECSS standard and all tests were executed in either the EMCS Engineering Model (equal to the EMCS on ISS) or the EMCS Reference Model, both located at N-USOC, Trondheim. Lessons learned from the Gravi2 integration phase include early familiarization of the hardware for all involved partners and retaining an interdisciplinary approach during the initial requirements collection stage and experiment design development phase as well as throughout the entire test campaign.","Integration  and  pre-experiment  test  flow  of  the  Gravi2 "

2314,AIAA-2016-5531,Projective invariant based crater matching for visual navigation in planetary landing,"This paper presents a new crater matching algorithm for visual navigation in planetary landing. For pin-point landing mission, IMU could not satisfy its goal because of cumulated error. Therefore crater detection and matching algorithm(CDMA) have been developed on that account. Since crater is a landmark on planetary surface, information about its absolute position can be obtained in advance. If a crater successfully detected and matched from the camera image, its absolute position helps to determine the landers position that can be used in navigation for pin-point landing mission. This paper concentrates only crater matching not detection. Projective invariant feature with five coplanar points are used to match crater. On crater image 4 sets of five coplanar points are obtained from intersection and cross-intersection between two ellipses and 2 invariants can be calculated according to each set of point respectively. To match image crater with database crater simple voting algorithm is used. LU78287GT, Lunar impact crater database, is used to simulate an image. Finally, performance of proposed crater matching algorithm will be compared with varying noise condition.","Projective Invariant Based Crater "

2318,AIAA-2016-4821,Cant Angle Effect,"A winglet is a device used to improve the efficiency of aircraft by lowering the lift induced dragcaused by wingtip vortices. It is a vertical or angled extension at the tips of each wing. Winglets improveefficiency by diffusing the shed wingtip vortex, which in turn reduces the drag due to lift and improves thewing¡¯s lift over drag ratio Winglets increase the effective aspect ratio of a wing without adding greatly to thestructural stress and hence necessary weight of its structure. In this research, a numerical validationprocedure (by FLUENT ?, computational fluid dynamics software with The Spalart-Allmaras turbulencemodel) is described for determination and estimation aerodynamic characteristics of three dimensionsubsonic rectangular wing (with NACA653218airfoil cross section). It was observed that at the present worka good agreement between the numerical study and the experimental work. This paper describes a CFD 3-dimensional winglets analysis that was performed on a Cessna wing of NACA2412 cross sectional airfoil.The wing has span 13.16 m, root chord 1.857 m, tip chord 0.928 m, sweep angle 11 degree and taper ratio0.5.

2321,AIAA-2016-4955,Emission Characteristics of Laminar Prevaporized Petroleum and Biodiesel Flames at near Stoichiometric Conditions,"Laminar flames of prevaporized Jet A and neat biodiesels (SME and CME) mixed with air were studied over a range of equivalence ratios of 0.9, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.5. Measurements of global NO and CO emission indices, radiative heat fraction, radial flame temperature and gas concentration profiles were performed and compared with the previously published results at higher equivalence ratios (2-7). The flame photographs indicated the presence of a bright blue inner cone that was surrounded by an outer less luminous blue cone. The global NO and CO emission indices were significantly influenced by equivalence ratio and the molecular chemistry of the fuel. At equivalence ratios 0.9-1.5, the Jet A flame had the highest NO emission index, whereas the CME flame had the lowest. The CO emission index, on the other hand, was comparable for all the flames. At the equivalence ratio of 1.2, the fuel chemistry played a dominant role in the NO emission index, but did not affect the CO emission index while at the equivalence ratio of 7, the fuel chemistry influenced the CO emission index significantly but did not affect the NO emission index. The peak flame temperatures at 10 mm flame height were comparable between all the tested flames at the equivalence ratio of 1.2. The peak NO concentration increased with flame height for all flames, whereas the peak CO concentration decreased with flame heights indicating that oxidation continued to occur at downstream heights. The measurements revealed the significance of fuel bound oxygen and chemistry of the fuel on pollutant emissions.","Petroleum and Biodiesel Flames at near Stoichiometric "

Thenumerical model employed the SST k-? turbulent model in the flow field and a threestepquasi-global chemical kinetics model for combustion simulation of C12H23 whichwas selected as kerosene surrogate. It is found that the distribution surface heat flux inRBCC engine which serves a vital role in the process of TPS design has its uniquecharacteristic at rocket-ejector mode, ramjet mode and scramjet mode, especially on thecombustor wall, the reasons for the non-uniform thermal environment are that the massflow rate of primary rocket and positions of combustion organization vary withoperating modes. Among the three typical operation conditions, Ma6.0 has the highestsurface heat flux, the averaged heat flux is 2MW/m2. The heat flux distribution on theside wall is lower than on the top and bottom wall because the influence area of theprimary rocket is limited which mainly effect the non-uniform distribution on the topand bottom wall. Another notable characteristic is that the cavity's thermalenvironment is quite different with the combustor wall, and the maximum heat flux isoften located at the trailing edge of the cavity which approximate to 5MW/m2, therefore,the TPS design of the cavity must consider this unique phenomenon. As concludingremarks, RBCC engine has a more complex surface thermal environment than ordinaryscramjet engine, the TPS design must depend on a comprehensive and detailed analysisto obtain a high efficient of closed-loop cooling cycle.","Thermal analysis of RBCC engine at ejector, ramjet and"

Thus, signi cantgeometry variances can occur in turbine blades due to operation and regeneration whicha ect the e ciency, the loads, and the lifetime of the blade. The present study addressesthe e ect of regeneration-induced geometry variances on the aerodynamic performance ofthe  nal low-pressure turbine (LPT) stage of a real jet engine. The geometry varianceswere determined by characteristic airfoil parameters, which were themselves derived frommeasured turbine blades. In order to analyze the e ect of the variances of the geometry onthe aerodynamic performance, a probabilistic simulations framework was developed. Thisconsists of a blade parameterization model, a modeling procedure for geometry variations,and quasi3D(Q3D) CFD simulations. It is shown that the e ect of regeneration-inducedvariances is dependent on the operating point. The largest scatter of isentropic e ciencyand stage loading coe cient occurs during approach.

The range of feasible frequencies can thenbe increased signi cantly whilst the minimum amplitude needed to initialize the switchingprocess can be lowered up to 90%. Large Eddy Simulations reveal that the preferredfrequencies found in the experiments correspond to the primary velocity uctuations insidethe shear layer with the global minimum in switching time matching the frequency of thenatural shear layer roll-up.

The proposed system was modelled using the IPSEpro software package and validated using manufacturer¡¯s published data. The exergoeconomic model evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the gas turbine engine based on the Specific Exergy Costing [SPECO] method. The CO2 emissions per KWh were estimated using a generic combustor model, HEPHAESTUS, developed at Cranfield University. It is well known that the exergetic analysis can determine the magnitudes, locations and types of losses within an energy system. The effect of load and ambient temperature variations on gas turbine performance were investigated for two different configurations. The first system, Case-I, was a simple gas turbine (SCGT) engine, and the second, Case-II, an intercooling gas turbine (ICGT) system. The latter enhances gas turbine efficiency but, at the same time, has an adverse effect on the combustion chamber due to reduced compressed air temperature. It was confirmed that full load and low ambient temperature are preferable due to the low waste exergy. The unit exergy cost rate for both SCGT and ICGT have been calculated as 8.59 and 8.32 US$/GJ respectively.

The presence of solid particles in the working fluid medium has an adverse effect on the durability of these engines as well as performance. Typical turbine blade damages include blade coating wear, sand glazing, Calcia-Magnesia-Alumina-Silicate (CMAS) attack, oxidation, and plugged cooling holes, all of which can cause rapid performance deterioration including loss of aircraft. This research represents the complex thermo-chemo-mechanical fluid structure interaction problem of semi-molten particulate impingement and infiltration onto ceramic thermal barrier coatings into its canonical forms. The objective of this research work is to understand the underpinning interface science of interspersed graded ceramic/metal and ceramic/ceramic composites at the grain structure level for robust coatings and bulk material components for vehicle propulsion systems. This research enhances our understanding of the fundamental relationship between interface properties and the thermo-mechanical behavior in dissimilar materials for materials by design systems, and creates the ability to develop and fabricate materials with targeted macroscale properties as a function of their interfacial behavior. This project creates a framework to enable the engineered design of solid-solid and liquid-solid interfaces in dissimilar functionalized materials to establish a paradigm shift toward science from the traditional empiricism in engineering thermal barrier coatings and high temperature highly loaded bulk materials. An integrated approach of modeling and simulation, characterization, fabrication, and validation to solve the fundamental questions of interface mechanisms which affect the properties of novel materials will be validated to guide component material solutions to visionary 2040+ military vehicle propulsion systems.","Anindya Ghoshal1, Muthuvel Murugan, Michael J.

2342,AIAA-2016-4690,Burning Rate and Ignition Delay Times of AP/HTPB-Based Solid Rocket Propellants Containing Graphene,"The purpose of additives in solid rocket propellants is to tailor the propellants¡¯ properties, primarily the burning rate and strength. While the use of graphene and its analogs in liquid monopropellants and other fields has been widely studied, there are very few investigations as to its effects on solid rocket propellants. The purpose of this study therefore was to determine the effects of graphene, specifically edge-functionalized graphene oxide (EFGO), on the burning rate, ignition delay time, and tensile strength of AP/HTPB-based solid rocket propellants. Two types of propellants were created, an 80% monomodal and an 85% bimodal, with 1% EFGO by mass in each. The 85% bimodal propellants consisted of one batch with plasticizer and one without. The EFGO was mixed into the propellants in a dry powder form. The samples were tested between pressures of 3.4 and 15.5 MPa (500 and 2250 psi) in a constant-volume vessel pressurized with inert argon gas. Results showed a no significant change in burning rate for the 80% monomodal propellants and only 3.9 and 6.4% increases for the 85% bimodal propellants with and without plasticizer, respectively. A significant increase in ductility and corresponding decrease in elastic modulus were observed for the 85% bimodal propellants. The effects of the graphene on the tensile strength however varied for each propellant type. Results showed that the strength of the 80% monomodal propellants increased, whereas the strength of the 85% bimodal propellants decreased slightly with EFGO addition. With the addition of 1% EFGO, the results showed 30.5 and 81.4% increases in ignition delay times for the 80% monomodal and 85% bimodal propellants with plasticizer, respectively. The ignition delay times of the 85% bimodal propellants without plasticizer increased by 120% compared to the baseline with plasticizer.","Burning Rate and Ignition Delay Times of AP/HTPB-Based "

2348,AIAA-2016-5064,Uncertainty Quantification and Management in Engine Conceptual Design,"In the aircraft engine industry, final approval of an engine design is often made late in the preliminary design phase, making cancellation very expensive should the engine fail to meet its requirements. The research objective is to demonstrate a process for quantifying uncertainty related to meeting performance targets early in the conceptual design of an aircraft engine. This work extends a set of uncertainty quantification and management (UQ&M) techniques previously adapted by the Georgia Institute of Technology for the design of commercial aircraft, to the design of an aircraft engine. This modified UQ&M enables the identification of design and margin variable settings that yield the highest probability of meeting component level requirements, and a corresponding set of ¡°mitigation actions¡± that improve the probability of meeting system level requirements in the event that a component is non-compliant. The process aids designers in balancing expected performance and reliability in meeting system level requirements. The UQ&M technique employs an optimizer to determine design variables and margins settings where they will be of the greatest benefit for ensuring system level requirements are met while meeting a reliability goal. A concept of mitigation action is also introduced to recover compliance due to uncertainty realizations. In general, there is a tradeoff between performance and reliability. Including mitigation effects within the optimization scheme aids in identifying engines that have a higher probability of recovery from uncertainty realization (5-20%), rather than applying mitigation after optimization (3-12%).","Uncertainty Quantification and Management in Engine "
2349,AIAA-2016-5065,Size Estimation and Performance Analysis of a New Intercooled and Recuperated Aero-engine,"Intercooled and recuperated aero-engines have been researched for a long time because of their good performance in both pollutant emissions and fuel consumption. Those studies usually focused on those concepts with baffling flow path, and had less analysis on size of heat exchangers. Those concepts are not capable of civil aero-engines, because of either their complex structures or non-ignorable flow-path loss. Therefore, a new intercooled and recuperated aero-engine was analyzed, and the structure is the same as a turbofan aero-engine, except increasing heat exchange systems in the flow path. The heat exchange systems transfer heat by medium. Because aero-engines have very rigorous space constraints, it should be discussed whether heat exchangers could be suitable for engine flow path. The size of both engine flow path and heat exchangers are estimated by using both engine performance calculation program and civil engine flow path program. This paper made a volume comparison between engine flow path and heat exchangers. The passage also showed a kind of ¡°black box heat exchangers¡± which can calculate engine performance by input heat exchange amount and pressure loss. Analysis about heat exchange amount effect on engine thrust and specific fuel consumption has been finished.","Size Estimation and Performance Analysis of a New "

The OpenFOAM?software is used to implement a 3D code for initial assessment of the vortex flow-field behavior. The finite volume code solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a RANS approach. Cold flow simulations are performed to characterize the fuel and oxidizer mixing. The second stage focuses on test firings. The fuel is a blend of paraffin (60 wt.%), and polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene grafted with maleic anhydride (SEBS, 40 wt.%). The oxidizer is gaseous oxygen (GOX). The test firings allow to evaluate the combustion efficiency, which is low due to the properties of the investigated fuel, and the regression rate, which is measured by using TOT-based data reduction and wire-cut sensors. The experimental and numerical obtained results show the opportunity to further investigate this unusual rocket configuration.","Vortex Combustion in a Hybrid Rocket Motor "
2351,AIAA-2016-4750,Scaling of Hybrid Rocket Motors with Swirling Oxidizer Injection - Part 2,"Hybrid rockets present some disadvantages, mainly low regression rates and combustioninefficiencies. A promising technology to solve both these issues is the swirling oxidizer injection,that causes an enhancement of the wall heat flux and of the mixing of the combustionreactants, and thus an increase of the regression rate and of the combustion efficiency.A numerical investigation is carried out with a commercial computational fluid dynamicscode. This type of analysis can really help with the comprehension of the physical phenomenahidden behind the experimental measurements, and so it can be a powerful aid in thepreliminary development and testing of hybrid rocket motors. The following paper is thecontinuation of a previous work by the authors. The first step of this numerical investigationis to study the motor with different injection swirl numbers at comparable mixture ratios,varying the length of the motor to obtain the desired ratios between the oxidizer mass fluxand the fuel mass flux. This process is important because the mixture ratio increases withthe swirl number due to the enhancement of the regression rate, and for this reason it isnot possible to draw conclusions on the variation of the combustion efficiency since it isnot correct to compare different motors working at different mixture ratios. Afterwards,the effect of the pressure on the performance is analyzed, because the configuration of themotor is obtained from a laboratory-scale model working at a combustion chamber pressurethat is low compared to the typical operating condition of a hybrid rocket motor.","Scaling of Hybrid Rocket Motors"

The numerical model is first validated for prediction of accurate steady state regression rates by comparison with existing experimental data. Unsteady simulation is then carried out by adding a mass flux perturbation to the steady state value and then following its temporal progress. No instabilities are found when the delay experienced by the wall heat flux to the changes in the regression rate is not modelled explicitly. Upon consideration of the delay, at first an oscillating periodic increase in the regression rate and chamber pressure is observed (linear regime). Then, a transition into a non-linear limit cycle ensues due to increasing non-linear effects. A positive ¡°DC Shift¡± is seen due to increase in the mean chamber pressure. The shift is found to be within 5 % of the mean value. Analysis of the linear region shows good correspondence to the prediction of frequency of oscillations. It is concluded that the computational model developed can be further successfully used for parametric analyses in the domain.","Quasi 1-D Numerical Analysis of Combustion Instability in "
2353,AIAA-2016-4877,Mach Disk Pressure Measurement Technique within Rotating Detonation Engine,"An accurate pressure measurement inside the rotating detonation channel has not been demonstrated to date. This is due to the harsh environment and rapidly varying pressure. A novel pressure measurement technique using a highly underexpanded jet structure external of a rotating detonation engine has been attempted. The jet structure is a linear function of the square root of the pressure ratio across the jet exit, independent of temperature and specific heat ratio. The RDE was operated with hydrogen and air, at equivalence ratio of 1.01 and air mass flow rate of 127 lbm/min. A simple LED, positive lenses, and high speed camera schlieren system was used to visualize the Mach disk. Preliminary results showed the underexpanded jet structure response time to be on the order of the camera acquisition period. Using a vacuum chamber, the system was calibrated with a known pressure ratio. By measuring the Mach disk distance from the nozzle and the exit pressure, the peak pressure within the detonation channel was estimated to be about 380.9?7 psia on average. Peak pressure as high as 556.5 psia was observed. Further efforts are needed to measure the lower pressure behind the detonation wave and during the refill.","Mach Disk Pressure Measurement Technique within "
2354,AIAA-2016-5500,A Unified Approach For Optical Survey Strategy Design of Resident Space Objects,"Orbital debris poses an increasing risk to manned space missions and operational satellites. Aslarger networks of electro-optical (EO) sensors are tasked for space surveillance in order to improvespatiotemporal knowledge of the ever-growing resident space object (RSO) population, it is imperativethat survey designs be autonomously generated such that they optimally balance the visibility, coverage,and estimation accuracy of RSOs as per the survey objective. To this end, we propose a framework toquantitatively evaluate designs of EO RSO surveys. Where appropriate, we inherit existing languageand conventions regarding EO sensor and survey design. These functions exhibit good linearity for thedomain of angle and angle-rate measurements that are usually captured in a single image, so a rapidlinear evaluation is locally feasible. A simulation comparing the visibility and coverage of two surveydesigns in the near geostationary orbit regime aligns with observer expectations.","A Uni?ed Approach For Optical Survey Strategy Design"

One way to reduce the timerequired for catalog buildup is to reduce the number of observations required for initial orbit determination(IOD). In this paper, ab initio RSO catalog generation is simulated for a single EO sensor site.There are two main technical contributions. The first is an extension of the two body integral-basedtwo-track IOD algorithm first developed by Gronchi, et al. that is conducive to both analytical andnumerical solutions of the dynamics. The second is a quantitative comparison between two- and threetrackcatalog generation via simulations. This work aims to maximize both the capacity and accuracy ofRSO surveys using EO sensors, with particular applications to the operation of so-called Raven-classtelescopes. Applying the proposed algorithm to angle and estimated angle-rate measurements takenover two nights resulted in a 50% increase in the number of objects observed compared to a conventionalsingle-night three-track surveillance cadence, while maintaining levels of estimation error that enablereliable follow-on observations.","Assessing Two-Track Initial Orbit Determination Methods"
2356,AIAA-2016-5502,Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli Space-Object Tracking with Joint Prediction and Update,"Space-object tracking systems require robust and accurate methods of multi-target stateestimation and prediction. This paper presents the application of labeled multi-Bernoulli lters for space-object tracking and leverages a joint prediction and update with Gibbssampling to improve computational e ciency. Based on the use of labeled random  nitesets, the  -Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli ( -GLMB)  lter provides a closed-formsolution to the Bayes recursion for a multi-target  lter. The Labeled Multi-Bernoulli lter is a principled approximation of the  -GLMB that reduces computational complexity.Upon combining these  lters with astrodynamics-based models for orbit state probabilitydensity function prediction and initial orbit determination, a 100-object simulation is usedto demonstrate the ability of these tools to track space objects in near-geosynchronousorbit. Both  lters converge on solutions with accuracies comparable to the measurementerror statistics and demonstrate similar performance as a function of detection probability,clutter, and the birth model employed. A robust comparison of the two  lters requiresfurther Monte Carlo-based tests to quantify variance in the solutions due to random inputs.","Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli Space-Object"
2357,AIAA-2016-5517,LIDAR-based Relative Navigation of Non-Cooperative Objects Using Point Cloud Descriptors,"Autonomous navigation relative to both natural (e.g., asteroids) and artificial (e.g., satellites) objectsis of great interest to the space community. Consequently, active three-dimensional (3D) sensors¡ª such as LIDARs ¡ª have received considerable interest for use during rendezvous with a noncooperativeobject. Most existing navigation solutions utilizing a LIDAR for proximity operationsnear a non-cooperative object rely on iterative closest point (ICP) for pose estimation. Unfortunately,ICP requires a good initial pose estimate to converge on a correct solution, and a poor ICP solutioncan have catastrophic effects on a navigation filter. To address this shortcoming, the present workconsiders two point cloud descriptor techniques popular in robotics that simultaneously recognizeand estimate relative pose of an object against a database of training images. The resulting relativepose is used as the good initial estimate to be updated by ICP before being introduced into the navigationfilter. The first descriptor considered is OUR-CVFH , which is a histogram style descriptorbased on the angular distribution of points and a repeatable semi-global reference frame. The seconddescriptor is a spin image, which is a 2D representation of a point cloud that utilizes proven imagecorrelation techniques to estimate pose. State estimation is performed using a relative position andinertial attitude MEKF for a simulated rendezvous with an artificial object. Filter state initializationis seldom discussed in literature, so a novel initialization approach is developed using a robust estimationtechnique modeled after RANSAC. Based on the probability of erroneous measurements, theminimum number of observations necessary for successful RANSAC initialization is derived.","LIDAR-based Relative Navigation of Non-Cooperative Objects"

The complete nonlinear dynamics of the motion ofthe follower satellite relative to the leader satellite is considered and the rigorous proof forthe stability of the controlled formation system is given in the presence of unknown externaldisturbances and unknown mass of the follower satellite. Although the controller design isbased on the concept of sliding mode control, the proposed control strategy is free fromchattering and guarantees a finite-time convergence of the controlled system to the targetarea. Furthermore, a simple adaptive law to automatically update the control gain issuggested that does not require a priori knowledge of the uncertainties of the system. Inaddition, to guarantee the robustness from the beginning and to improve the transientperformance, a new sliding surface is also constructed. Numerical simulations are carriedout to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive controller to maintain adesired formation configuration by compensating for the initial offset errors and externaldisturbance effects including gravitational perturbations and atmospheric drag.","Satellite Formation Control Using Continuous Adaptive "

2361,AIAA-2016-4892,Flame-Flow interaction under Distributed Combustion Conditions,"Colorless Distributed Combustion (CDC) has shown simultaneous benefits of high combustion efficiency, ultra-low pollutants emission, low noise, uniform thermal field, and enhanced stability. Distributed combustion is fostered by reduced oxygen concentration and high temperature oxidizer to result in distributed reaction over a larger volume of the combustor. In this paper, the interaction between the velocity field (characterized through Particle Image Velocimetry) and the reaction region (identified through hydroxyl Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence) is investigated with focus on swirl assisted distributed combustion. A mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide was mixed with normal air upstream of the burner to simulate the hot reactive gases. The flowfield was characterized under non-reacting conditions to outline the impact of burner confinement and added dilution on the flowfield. The results showed that confinement and dilution enhanced both the inner recirculation and outer recirculation zones. Reacting flowfield, characterized to determine the impact of the temperature rise and density changes, showed maximum velocity region to shift downstream. Comparing the PIV data for reacting conditions with OH-PLIF revealed significant difference between swirl flames and CDC. In swirl flame, the flame was located around the shear layer of the entry jet (with both the inner and outer recirculation zones) where the velocity fluctuations and OH-PLIF fluctuations coincided. Flame transitioning to CDC pushed the reaction zone further downstream to locate at position of low velocity in a reverse image of that found for swirl flames. In addition, the reaction occupied a much larger volume with lower signal intensity to exhibit distributed reaction.","Flame-Flow interaction under Distributed Combustion "

Unproven propulsion systems with paradigmshiftinghigh thrust-to-power ratios enable endo/exoatmospheric flight trajectories to ¡°flyanywhere in the world in about two hours.¡± When a wide range of vehicle designs and flighttrajectory scenarios were tested against disruptive propulsion technology performancemetrics, the best-performing vehicle had a counterintuitive design. The vehicle was a mostlyconventionally built commercial composite aircraft, which exhibited small, stubby foldingwings, and a NASA-like elliptical cross-section fuselage for 180 passengers. The vehicle isroughly the size of a Boeing 737 MAX 9, possessing both vertical lift and horizontalthrusting propulsion. A Mach 5+ hypersonic aircraft approach was also evaluated in thetrade space but considered unworkable for commericial air travel due to an unacceptablepercent of vehicle mass required by the thermal protection system (TPS), a high airframemanufacturing price, and a lack of reusability and economic maintainability. However, anew endo/exoatmospheric (in atmosphere/vacuum of space) flight profile traded favorably.The aircraft maintains a near horizontal attitude throughout all flight regimes for passengercomfort, subject¡¯s passengers to only moderate g-forces, and flies mostly subsonic to localconditions while avoiding aeroheating and preventing the formation of sonic booms that willotherwise reach the ground. The vehicle takes off from conventional airports, ascendsvertically to the minimum vacuum of space, and accelerates forward to high velocity to makerange while maintaining constant altitude with vertical thrusting. The vehicle then reverseshorizontal thrust to slow down prior to atmospheric reentry, performs a near verticalpowereddescent, and lands vertically or enters a conventional aircraft landing pattern.

The ExoMars 2016 is the firstmission of the ESA¡¯s ExoMars Programme. The mission comprises the Trace Gas Orbiter(TGO) and the Entry, Descent and Landing demonstrator (Schiapparelli EDM) launched inMarch 2016. The TGO will perform the data relay of all Mars proximity communications ofthe ExoMars Rover mission planned to be launched in 2020, and enhance thecommunication network for the already present and future NASA assets on the Martiansurface.

The calculation cost of the shadow effect for a high-fidelity geometrical model is too high to apply to a practical astrodynamics analysis. Thus, authors have proposed a pre-computed method for a fast and precise solar radiation calculation. In this method, the visibility function for each micro-surface is calculated beforehand and then expanded to a set of basis functions in an offline pre-computation stage. In the real-time calculation phase, the coefficients corresponding to the basis functions are used for fast and precise solar radiation computation. One of the key points of the proposed method is the selection of the basis functions, and this paper compares two major spherical basis functions for accurate and efficient shadow representation. Several calculation examples of the three-dimensional objects are demonstrated to evaluate the computational cost and accuracy of the proposed method. The examples show that the proposed method is capable of providing an efficient and accurate real-time solar radiation pressure computation with a capability of the optical property estimation.","A Study of Shadow Representation for                              "

NASA and commercial activities have been advancingboth spacecraft bus and telecom capabilities that lend themselves to providing more mass,power and data bandwidth at further distances from Earth. Solar electric propulsion is akey enabler to transport mass more efficiently from Earth to Mars and then provide highpower in-situ, even with the reduced solar radiance. Very large, lightweight solar arrays arebeing developed along with highly efficient electric thrusters with their high voltage powersupplies. Commercial satellite technologies used today in geosynchronous satellites, likepower combining and large apertures at various frequencies, can be applied to takeadvantage of these mass/power benefits afforded by solar electric propulsion. As seen in thecurrent commercial transport contracts to take cargo and astronauts to the InternationalSpace Station, business opportunities can arise to commercially supply transportation andcommunication services between Earth and Mars at affordable and predictable levels.

2378,AIAA-2016-5336,Finding the Optimal Spatial Geometry in an Earth-Moon Mission,"This work deals with a preliminary mission analysis to find the best geometricalparameters of the terminal orbits ¨C Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Low Moon Orbit (LMO) ¨Cof an Earth-Moon mission by means of a spatial lunar patched-conic approximationformulated in the present paper. The Earth-Moon transfer problem considers that theterminal orbits are circular, and that all the Keplerian elements of the LEO and of the LMOare prescribed, but the true latitude of the point of the application of the impulses. Thetransfer problem based on the spatial patched-conic approximation involves the solution of atwo-point boundary value problem obtained by means of Newton-Raphson algorithm. Afterthat, a one degree of freedom optimization problem is formulated which minimizes the fuelconsumption represented by the total velocity increment. The transfer problem is alsoformulated considering the dynamics of the Spatial Circular Restricted Three-BodyProblem (SCR3BP). A two-point boundary value problem and a one degree of freedomoptimization problem are also enunciated for this model. The optimization problems basedon the two dynamical models are solved by means of the Sequential Gradient RestorationAlgorithm (SGRA). In the present study, only direct ascent maneuvers with a time of flightof 2.5 to 4.0 days are considered. The altitude of the LEO and the altitude of the LMO areset equal to 167 km and 100 km, respectively. Numerical results show that the trajectoriesprovided by the patched-conic approximation and the SCR3BP are too close to each one,which enhances the possibility to utilize this patched-conic approximation in a preliminarymission analysis. According to the results, a great amount of fuel consumption can be savedif the longitude of the ascending node of the LMO is chosen properly. By taking advantage ofthe numerical performance associated to the processing speed of the spatial patched-conicapproximation, this model is applied to determine several optimal trajectories byparameterization of the terminal orbital elements to find the best combination of them thatminimizes the fuel consumption.","Finding the optimal spatial geometry in an Earth-Moon "

Due to the similaritybetween the robotic on-orbit servicing and active debris removal missions, the concept of autonomousactive debris removal using space robotic manipulators is appealing in terms of technology readinesslevel. Although numerous human-in-the-loop on-orbit servicing missions involving robotic captures ofspacecraft were successfully performed, a fully autonomous robotic capture in space, especiallyconsidering non-cooperative objects is still an open subject facing enormous technical challenges. Thispaper proposed a new incremental inverse kinematics based vision servo approach for roboticmanipulators to capture a non-cooperative target autonomously. The target¡¯s pose and motion areestimated by a vision system using integrated photogrammetry and EKF algorithm. Based on the inputof target¡¯s pose and motion, the forward kinematics of robot manipulator is inversed in an incrementalform where the robotic manipulator moves by increments from its current configuration. By adoptingthis approach, the multiple-solution problem of the inverse kinematics has been avoided. Since thevelocity of the end-effector in Cartesian space in the current approach is always pointing to the targetin the next moment, the possibility of losing track of the target by the vision system is greatly reduced.The proposed approach is validated by a hardware-in-the-loop simulation, where the pose and motionof the non-cooperative target is estimated by a real vision system.

The geometric factors of the vortex generators studied included height, length, spacing, and positions upstream and downstream of the inlet terminal shock. The flow through the inlet was simulated through the computational solution of the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations on multi-block, structured grids. The vortex generators were simulated by either gridding the geometry of the vortex generators or modeling the vortices generated by the vortex generators. The inlet performance was characterized by the inlet total pressure recovery, total pressure distortion, and incompressible shape factor of the boundary-layer at the engine face. The results suggested that downstream vanes reduced the distortion and improved the boundary layer.

Experimentsconducted with NASA's Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) Testbed on theInternational Space Station provide a unique opportunity to evaluate advanced communi-cation techniques, such as bandwidth-e cient modulations, in an operational ight system.Demonstrations of these new techniques in realistic ight conditions provide critical ex-perience and reduce the risk of using these techniques in future missions. E cient useof spectrum is enabled by using high-order modulations coupled with e cient forwarderror correction codes. This paper presents a high-rate, bandwidth-e cient waveform op-erating over the 225 MHz Ka-band service of the TDRS System (TDRSS). The testingexplores the application of Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK), 2/4/8-phase shiftkeying (PSK) and 16/32- amplitude PSK (APSK) providing over three bits-per-second-per-Hertz (3 b/s/Hz) modulation combined with various forward error correction codesto maximize throughput. With a symbol rate of 200 Mbaud, coded data rates of 1000Mbps were tested in the laboratory and up to 800 Mbps over the TDRS 225 MHz channel.This paper will present on the high-rate waveform design, channel characteristics, per-formance results, compensation techniques for  ltering and equalization, and architectureconsiderations going forward for e cient use of NASA's infrastructure.","Bandwidth-E?cient Communication through 225 MHz"
2397,AIAA-2016-5011,Development And Analysis of a Group 1 UAV Series Hybrid Power System with Two Engine Options,"A hybrid gas-electric propulsion system has been developed at the US Air Force Academy for use in Group 1 (< 20 lb) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system is a series hybrid configuration consisting of an engine that runs an alternator to convert shaft power into electrical power. The electric propeller motor can draw power from the alternator or a battery. This investigation focused on the conversion efficiency from fuel energy to electrical energy, so no batteries were used to supplement the propeller power. The performances of a 738W 4-stroke engine and a 1253W 2-stroke engine were compared as installed in the hybrid system to determine the maximum power and endurance achievable on a conceptual UAV. A conceptual UAV with the hybrid system installed as tested is predicted to have a maximum power output of 350W, a maximum power to weight ratio of 0.063 kW/kg and a maximum cruise endurance of 5 hours at 10,930 feet density altitude, depending on the fuel load and engine.

For linear analysis, The mistunedcomponents are moved to the right-hand side of the equations of motion, and treated asthe nonlinear excitation forces of the mistuned bladed disk. Therefore, the linear mistunedproblem is transformed into a nonlinear tuned one, and can be solved using only a singlesector of the bladed disk. For nonlinear analysis, the mistuning forces can be integratedwith the existing nonlinear loads, such as aerodynamic loads or structural nonlinearities,and thus no extra computational e orts are required. Conventional time-marching schemesfor uid-structure interaction problems can be readily utilized in the newly proposed meth-ods. A simpli ed mistuned bladed disk is used as the numerical example.

2408,AIAA-2016-4632,Ion Optics,"A Long Duration Test (LDT) was initiated in June 2005 as a part of NASA¡¯s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) service life validation approach. Testing was voluntarily terminated in February 2014, with the thruster accumulating 51,184 hours of operation, processing 918 kg of xenon propellant, and delivering 35.5 MN-s of total impulse. The post-test inspection objectives for the ion optics were derived from the original NEXT LDT test objectives, such as service life model validation, and expanded to encompass other goals that included verification of in situ measurements, test issue root causes, and past design changes. The ion optics cold grid gap had decreased only by an average of 7% of pretest center grid gap, so efforts to stabilize NEXT grid gap were largely successful. The upstream screen grid surface exhibited a chamfered erosion pattern. Screen grid thicknesses were ¡Ý 86% of the estimated pretest thickness, indicating that the screen grid has substantial service life remaining. Deposition was found on the screen aperture walls and downstream surfaces that was primarily composed of grid material and back-sputtered carbon, and this deposition likely caused the minor decreases in screen grid ion transparency during the test. Groove depths had eroded through up to 35% of the accelerator grid thickness. Minimum accelerator aperture diameters increased only by about 5-7% of the pretest values and downstream surface diameters increased by about 24-33% of the pretest diameters. These results suggest that increasing the accelerator aperture diameters, improving manufacturing tolerances, and masking down the perforated diameter to 36 cm were successful in reducing the degree of accelerator aperture erosion at larger radii.","Post-test Inspection of NASA¡¯s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster "

Initial results indicate that all commissioning requirements were met and that the thrusters are ready for subsequent science operations to demonstrate ¡°drag free¡± flight. While the electrospray propulsion systems developed for DRS are a great success, the colloid micronewton thrusters are designed as single-string (no redundancy) with a 90-day propellant load. Any subsequent follow-on Gravity Wave Observatory (GWO) mission, such as eLISA, would require full redundancy within each propulsion chain, as well as increased propellant throughput for a 2 to 5-year mission. As an initial step towards such a system, Busek and JPL demonstrated one fully redundant string of a dual-string thruster feed system consisting of an increased capacity metal diaphragm tank for 10 years of propellant (approximately 1 liter / 1.5 kg for each thruster), and two flow controlling valves operating in series. Tests included component-level environmental tests and assembly-level performance and end-of-life tests to bring the new feed system to TRL 5.

By employing 95 wt.% hydrogen peroxide instead of 90 wt.%, specific impulse and density specific impulse of the hybrid rocket becomes higher than those of hybrid rockets using nitrous oxide. It makes a hybrid rocket much lighter and smaller for same mission. To design hybrid rocket using 95 wt.% hydrogen peroxide, fuel reression rate is an important to acquire high performance and it must be verified by experimentally. Hot-firing tests were performed to acquire a regression rate of the 250 N hybrid rocket. We chose high density polyethylene as solid fuel in this study. We derived the regression rate equation from experimental data. The regression rate was improved by averaged 28.1 % comparing with the regression rate using 90 wt.% hydrogen peroxide. Characteristic velocity efficiency was also improved and it is higher than 94 %. Oxidizer fuel ratio shifting was also reduced significantly, and the shortened ignition delay was observed.","Performance Evaluation of Hybrid Rocket using 95 wt.% "

Though the primary goal of ammonium perchlorate and boron additions was to enhance the low specific impulse performance found for staged hybrid rocket engine, experimental evaluation of combustion characteristics is prerequisite for the application, and therefore this has been the focus of the paper. A series of combustion tests were carried out to analyze and evaluate the effect of additives on specific impulse performance, effluent temperature, and O/F variation. To maintain the hybrid rocket engine advantages, upper limit of ammonium perchlorate and boron contents in solid fuel was set to be 15 and 5 wt%, respectively. As a result, 15 wt% ammonium perchlorate added solid fuel showed 2.8% higher specific impulse performance compared to the baseline solid fuel. Moreover, ammonium perchlorate addition proved to offer less injected oxidizer mass flow, less O/F variation, and less combustion pressure while producing fuel-rich effluent of the same combustion temperature. The results also suggested that, when adding boron to solid fuel, it helped to provide more uniform radial temperature distribution and also to increase specific impulse by 3.2%.","AP and Boron Combustion Characteristics                            "
2416,AIAA-2016-4866,Nondestructive Mapping of Hybrid Rocket Fuel Grains,"The regression rates of solid fuels used in hybrid rocket motors are a critical parameter in the design and development of hybrid propulsion systems. Currently, it is difficult to measure fuel geometries accurately, thus causing difficulties in accurately describing regression rates, especially for smaller scale systems. Nondestructive techniques can solve this problem, as it is not necessary to get tooling into the ports. An apparatus that maps the fuel grain employing an immersed ultrasound transducer has been manufactured; its results will be the primary focus of this study. The full geometry of the fuel grains can be generated pre and post fire, which may lead to greater understanding of the way hybrid rocket fuels burn. Furthermore, previously undetectable defects, such as cracks and voids, may be identified. The study found that the method used to cast the fuel grains, spin casting causes thinning in wall thickness on average of 11.3% with a standard deviation of 1.2% from the end to the middle of the fuel grain. The generated data can further validate proposed analytical solutions (Cantwell, 2014) to the regression rate equations (Marxman and Gilbert, 1963) associated with hybrid rocket propulsion systems.","Nondestructive Mapping of Hybrid Rocket Fuel Grains "

This technique is based on the measurement of the oxidizer mass flow rate and the pressure levels in the prechamber and in the postchamber, and allows estimating the combustion efficiency evolution over the burning time as well. A one-dimensional, steady-state model, which takes into account the variation of the thermodynamic properties along the fuel grain port, is used to predict thermo-fluid-dynamic parameters across the combustion chamber as a function of the regression rate. An experimental test case, which shows the typical features of the axial-injection motor studied at the University of Naples, has been successfully analyzed, revealing the capability of this technique to capture the fundamental aspects of the rocket internal ballistics.","Pressure-Measurement Based Estimation of Fuel "

The primary issue associated with theconventionally manufactured thruster systems is the complexity of the component assembly, where the motorcase, injector, ignition electrodes, nozzle retainer, nozzle, fuel grain, insulting liner, and fuel grains arefabricated individually and assembled by hand. For very small thruster systems, detailed fabrication andassembly process is extremely labor intensive and time-consuming. Proposed ""all-additive"" designs reducecomponent fabrication and procurement cycle time, and significantly reduce overall system complexity. Astudent-lead design team reduced the trade-space to 3-basic options.

2419,AIAA-2016-5069,Swirling Motion in Rockets with Arbitrary Headwall Injection,"This study focuses on the development of several approximations for the swirling mean flowfield ina cylindrical rocket motor where allowance is made for both sidewall and headwall mass injection. Inconformance with conventional idealizations of solid and hybrid rockets, the sidewall injection velocity is takento be uniform, whereas the headwall injection is prescribed according to one of several axisymmetric patternsthat may be associated with forward injector configurations or grain specifications at forward closures. Theensuing model can thus be applied to both solid rocket motors (SRMs) and hybrid rocket engines (HREs)by carefully modulating the headwall injection speed. Starting with the inviscid, axisymmetric, and steadyEuler equation, or equivalently, the Bragg-Hawthorne formulation for the stream function, the solution thatwe pursue corresponds to a rotational, incompressible, non-reactive, helical flowfield of the Trkalian type.The resulting motion exhibits a swirling velocity that increases linearly with the distance from the headwallwhile satisfying the wall-normal injection requirement at the sidewall in both axial and radial directions. Bycombining the principles of orthogonality and superposition, a Fourier-like approximation is constructed andshown to be capable of accommodating a rather arbitrary inlet fore-end profile. Additionally, a matchedasymptotic expansion in small viscosity is pursued to permit the fulfillment of the no slip requirementin the tangential velocity at the sidewall. Both velocity and vorticity distributions that accompany thisgeneralized formulation are subsequently examined and discussed, as well as the residual error that canaccrue in some of the attendant approximations, especially while moving away from the centerline. As alimiting process verification, we show that the former swirling flow expression (Majdalani, J., and Fist, A.,¡°Improved Mean Flow Solution for Solid Rocket Motors with a Naturally Developing Swirling Motion,¡±50th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, Cleveland, OH, AIAA Paper 2014-4016) may berecovered as a special case and that the error at the sidewall diminishes when the viscous boundary layercorrection is accounted for. Finally, all profiles are verified computationally using a finite volume solver andcompared to other existing models in the literature.","Generalized Trkalian Flows: Swirling Motion in Rockets"

Combination injection didn¡¯t show intermediate mixing characteristics of perpendicular and sweptback injection. The pseudo-shock wave showed sizable effects to reduce differences among injection schemes and to promote mixing.

To attain high thrust level in wide operation range, thermal chokingwithin the diverging combustor is preferable, while occurrence of large scale separationmakes prediction of the flow field very difficult. Although there are numerous semiempiricalmodels for prediction within the constant area combustors, little can be found onthe flow field within the diverging combustors, which enables injection of further amount offuel in comparison to the constant area duct. In the present study, a one-dimensional modelwas proposed to predict the thermally choked flow filed as well as the precombustion shocksystem propagation, and comparison with experiments showed good agreement.","Performance Prediction of Diverging Dual-mode "

Themodel is derived on the basis of the well known CCW theory for treating general shockdynamics in non-uniform channels. Two models are proposed with varying degrees ofaccuracy and complexity. The reduced-order model consists of a single governing ordinarydi erential equation on the shock, while the higher-order model is comprised of two coupledordinary di erential equations. Both models are analyzed and compared for di erent initialshock Mach numbers in calorically and thermally perfect air. It was determined that thehigher-order model is inuenced by molecular vibrational excitation to a larger degreethan the reduced-order model. A major feature of the higher-order model is the ability toincorporate the non-uniform nature of the ow following a shock wave. This proves to becritical as the gas dynamic ow  eld in a pulse detonation engine is non-uniform in nature.It is shown that the higher-order model better predicts the nozzle shock dynamics by takinginto account the initial ow non-uniformity at the nozzle throat behind the transmittedshock wave.","Analytical Model of Shock Dynamics in Pulse"

Here rotating detonation waves of hydrogen-air mixture are numerically studied to find out criteria for them to pass the obstacles. The transient density-based solver with explicit formulation, the laminar finite-rate model with one step reaction and the standard k-epsilon model with standard wall functions are used. Rectangular obstacles of different sizes are set near the inlet of the combustor. Rotating detonation waves turning around the obstacles are shown mainly by pressure and temperature contours. Following conclusions are obtained. If the obstacle is much lower than the detonation wave, the rotating detonation wave will turn around to be reconstructed. If the obstacle height is roughly equivalent to the detonation height or higher than the detonation height, the rotating detonation wave will be strongly weakened in lack of reactants and fail. The study may help rotating detonation engines change the combustion mode from detonation to deflagration.","Criteria for rotating detonation to pass obstacles near the "

The vessel was mounted on a rotating stage to realize a similar situation to thespinning tanks of the upper-stage launch vehicles during its coasting flight. The liquidbehavior inside the vessel were successfully visualized. Due to the combined effects of surfacetension and the centrifugal force, the contact line on the cylinder wall advanced toward thegaseous side during the dropping after separation.

Observing a target far from the Earth enables acquiring dataabout condition of an early universe or exoplanets. High pointing accuracy is requiredfor acquiring a high resolution image of a target. Vibration generated by equipments ina bus part declines the pointing accuracy of an observation satellite, therefore methodsusing Tip Tilt Mirror and Stewart Platform have been studied for suppressing the inu-ence of vibration. However, because these conventional methods use actuators, there arepossibilities that observation with high pointing accuracy must be despaired if those actu-ators are broken. The proposed mechanism is not requiring actuators for suppressing theinuence of vibration. The proposed mechanism is utilizing ux pinning effect and enablesconnection between mission and bus parts of an observation satellite using pinning forcerather than mechanical structure. Pinning force, which works as magnetic force, can beapproximated by linear spring damping force. Our aim is to build micro vibration isolatorthat enables suppressing the vibration without any control using ux pinning effect.

2433,AIAA-2016-5112,The Testing of a Small-Scale Wave Rotor for Use as a Modified Brayton-Cycle Engine,"As gas turbine turbomachinery becomes smaller and requires less mass flow, component and cycle efficiencies drop significantly. Experimental and analytic evidence suggests that wave rotors are less susceptible to this scaling degradation, and as such are a potential replacement for small-scale power systems for unmanned aerial systems. In an effort to explore this area, a proof of concept rig was designed and built to function as a key component towards implementing Brayton-like cycles for low power requirements. Utilizing a small wave rotor, 1.6 kg/min of ambient air is compressed, routed through a burner, expanded and ejected at conditions with a temperature increase by a factor of three and a 30% pressure increase. These exhaust conditions enable production of 1.8 kW of power at sea level. To achieve this, the wave rotor was operated at 38,500 RPM and coupled to an external combustor. Experimental testing first consisted of uncoupled component testing of the combustor and wave rotor to ensure design point operability. Significant effort was accomplished to establish the proper combustor operation for various inlet conditions including temperature, pressure, and mass flow. The wave rotor design speed was achieved and an investigation into the wave rotor¡¯s various rotordynamic and vibrational modes was accomplished. Significant headway towards coupling the components into a closed loop system has occurred. The goal is to achieve an increase in the cycle efficiency at low mass flow by using a wave rotor with Brayton-like cycle.","The Testing of a Small-Scale Wave Rotor for Use as a "

In addition, the noise regulations around the rocket launching stations due to the environmental concern have made jet noise a crucial problem in the present day aero-acoustics research. In this paper three-dimensional jet acoustic characterization of chevron nozzles have been executed. The numerical studies have been carried out using a validated steady 3D density based, SST k-¦Ø turbulence model with enhanced wall functions. In the numerical study, a fully implicit finite volume scheme of the compressible, Navier¨CStokes equations is employed. We observed through the parametric analytical studies that a case with nine lobes with aerodynamically designed round edge and curved tip chevron nozzle is better than a conventional CD nozzle for jet noise reduction. We inferred that the geometry optimization of a chevron nozzle with aerodynamically efficient tip contours for facilitating silent exit flow will enable a sound reduction on the order of 0.33 % while comparing with the conventional rocket nozzle jet noise with Mach number range of 4 to 5 at the exit. Through this optimization we have assured improved payload capability through reduction in nozzle weight and marginal increase in liftoff thrust. We comprehended that the aerodynamically optimized tip contours with suitable number of round edged chevrons designed based on the exit Mach number is the best nozzle choice for the lower stage rockets. We conjectured that an environmental friendly chevron nozzle can warrant significant jet noise reduction during the takeoff of any aerospace launch vehicles without affecting the mission demanding the thrust-time requirements. We concluded that the conventional rocket nozzle can be converted into an environmental friendly chevron nozzle with better liftoff performance.","3D Jet Acoustic Characterization of Environmental Friendly "
2436,AIAA-2016-5375,Dawn's Mission At Ceres,"Dawn is NASA's ninth Discovery class mission. The Dawn spacecraft was designed toorbit both the giant asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres in succession, a missiononly made possible by the high e ciency of ion propulsion. While the same spacecraftvisited both bodies, the mission planning and maneuver execution at the two bodies werenecessarily very di erent. The mission at Vesta bene ted from at least three functioningreaction control wheels. At Ceres, all maneuvering and coasting during transfers wasdone without reaction wheel control due to the loss of the second of four wheels whiledeparting Vesta. Loss of the second wheel made conserving attitude control propellant(hydrazine) critical to achieving mission success at Ceres. To save hydrazine, avoidingunnecessary coasting and attitude turns became essential during the interplanetary cruiseto Ceres and for all transfers once at Ceres. In contrast, operations at Vesta did notneed to avoid coasting. Operating at Ceres requires being farther from the Sun. Greaterheliocentric distances (approaching 3 A.U.) make Dawn's attitude control constraints whilemaneuvering more restrictive as a result of reduced control authority.","Dawn¡¯s Mission at Ceres"

This study focuses on an approach to model asteroid gravity  elds, namely, multiple-body modeling. Computation of gravity potential serves as a  rst step to determine equi-librium points called Lagrangian points for a spacecraft orbiting an asteroid. Further,Jacobi analysis is carried out to determine zero-velocity regions, i.e., inaccessible regionscorresponding to the unstable Lagrangian points. Multiple sphere modeling was studiedthrough analysis of so called Asteroid as a Restricted Three and Four Body Problem, pro-viding insight into the method of modeling an asteroid as a cluster of multiple spheres incontact with each other and rotating with a constant angular velocity about the center ofmass of the cluster. To validate such an approach, a spherical harmonics approximation wasthen investigated.This approximation was used to model an ellipsoid. Finally the equiva-lence of the above two methods was validated by considering a con guration of a clusterof spheres that can approximate an ellipsoid. The merits of multi-sphere modeling overspherical harmonics include, accounting for mass distribution and ease of computation.","Lagrangian Points and Jacobi Constants"

2462,AIAA-2016-4805,Development of Distributed Control Systems for Aircraft Turbofan Engines,"Decentralized distributed engine control (DEC) enables a control architecture to support the standards envisionedfor the next generation of aircraft propulsion control systems. DEC seeks to advance current aircraftcontrol systems through the use of a digital communication network incorporating a range of smart componentsdesigned to improve engine efficiency, performance, and life cycle costs. Communication constraints likelimited bandwidth, time delays, and packet dropouts can limit performance of DEC, so good design prioritizesrobustness enough to meet these constraints and handle the failures and delays of these networks. Currently,however, there is no good way to model the effects of the distributed control system, and finding a method tosimulate these effects has been a matter of great interest for AFRL, NASA, and original engine manufacturers(OEMs). This paper explains a novel method for modeling distributed control, incorporating a thermodynamicengine model and a series of signal delays to simulate the communication constraints involved with the use of anetwork architecture. To demonstrate the implementation of this novel control organization with current aircraftpropulsion systems, the controllers of thermodynamic turbofan engine models, provided by NASA, havebeen designed and adjusted to include concepts of a distributed control architecture to provide data regardingthe control capability and engine performance of these models in response to certain operating conditions.","Development of Distributed Control Systems for Aircraft"
2463,AIAA-2016-4806,Modeling of a Gas Turbine Using Distributed Networks with Smart Nodes and Multiple Time Delays,"Industry is currently moving toward replacing the current centralized approach to turbine engine control with a distributed approach, using digital communications for feedback instead of point to point analog communications. Much of the research in this area has been lacking the inclusion of the possibility of multiple delays, which is likely in systems where there are distributed sensors and actuators with digital communication, as in the turbine engine. The system also is a sampled-data system because of digital communication, which is modelled as a discrete-time system. Besides not modeling the multiple delays, past research has also often ignored how the conversion of the continuous-time operation of the turbine engine will affect the modeling. This paper applies novel robust stability formulations to the often overlooked issues of modeling multiple delays and including the effects of sampling the continuous-time system. In this paper, an improved modeling technique for multiple delays will be introduced which applies to distributed engine controls (DEC), as well as to the larger field of distribute networked control systems (NCS), based on the augmented delay free system (ADFS) framework. From here a dynamic compensator and an estimator based formulation will be developed and used to produce theorems for structured robust stability bounds. These theorems will differ from most existing formulations by placing the bound on uncertainty in the continuous-time plant model, which will be converted into the discrete-time ADFS. The robust stability bounds will then be used to develop a control optimization process which provides a control gain that produces the local maximum tolerance to the given uncertainty structure. Examples will be provided to demonstrate the importance of modeling the delay and the control design, using C-MAPSS 40K. The control design will be used to compare how including a model-based estimator will affect the robust stability performance.","Modeling of a Gas Turbine Using Distributed Networks with "
2464,AIAA-2016-4711,Principles of High-efficiency Electric Flight,"To maximize energy efficiency of aircraft electric propulsion with one or more propellers and permanent-magnet (PM) electrical machines, we first introduce a simple circuit model of the electrical power system at full power, modeling a fixed or variable torque loss, in lieu of a fixed ¡°no-load current.¡± Next, motor-generator rotational speed, current, and torque are non-dimensionalized. The approach is validated with test data for various machines and voltages. We then show that a given combination of torque, rotational speed, system resistance, and maximum system efficiency at full power requires specific values of battery EMF, current, and motor constant, all solved iteratively with the proposed method. For cruise, theory and data reveal serious losses, well beyond ¡°chopping,¡± of pulse-width modulation (PWM). DC-DC conversion is then introduced as a high-efficiency power-conditioning alternative, borrowing from ground-electric-vehicle ¡°regenerative-braking¡± technology. Here PWM proves essential in a different role, adjusting converter voltage gain. Finally, the method is applied to optimize the power architecture of a sport-electric aircraft, demonstrating high efficiency at all conditions, including cruise and regeneration.

The core-separated fan propulsion system, which is mostly considered for use with distributed propulsion, differs greatly from conventional jet engines because the driving power is delivered from the core engines, located separately from the propulsion fans. The system offers great freedom in design space because of its mostly independent design for the propulsor and core engine with relaxed connection via the electric drive and transmission components. Using a recent key performance parameter analysis from NASA, the benefits and challenges of the SOFC-GT hybrid core are examined.

The results show that shocktrain is affected by the dual mechanism of isolator wall temperature and airflow totaltemperature. With an increase of wall temperature and a reduction of total temperature,the length of shock train increases. This tendency can be characterized by the variationof shock train length with ratio of wall temperature to total temperature, viz., shocktrain length increases with ratio of wall temperature to total temperature.

Additive Manufacturing, or AM, hasbecome one of the most publicized manufacturing techniques with particular emphasis on3D printing. While this manufacturing method has drawn great interest in recent years, itsorigin is actually dates back to the late 1800s in terms of its predecessor, namelyphotosculpture. This area of artisanship led to the basic concepts of stereolithography whichwere proposed in the 1950s and constructed devices for object creation using AM in the1970s and 1980s. Through the years of advancements several manufacturing techniqueshave emerged that lend themselves to small scale and consumer manufacturing devices. Thisstudy primarily focuses on Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Stereolithography (SLA)due to the inexpensive small scale consumer devices available and potential for scalability.The work is motivated by the need to assess the ability to create complex core geometries,which are difficult to construct using conventional methods, and a means of embedding fueladditives, such as aluminum particles, into the propellant cartridge. A survey ofcommercially available solutions is assessed followed by how these solutions can be utilizedfor the desired results. The findings show that while geometry issues are resolved with any ofthe additive methods the addition of fuel additives proves to be most difficult, especiallywhen a desired distribution is required or uniformity is expected. In this work we restrictour interested in additives to that of aluminum particles. Methods of particle addition aredetermined and discussed for their merits as is a new method of embedding particles into thepropellant.

HK40 was initially designed to operate with SmCo permanent magnets. To op-timize the magnetic  eld topology, the permanent magnets were replaced with iron-coreelectromagnets. The thruster is operated with di erent magnetic coil currents to observethe changes in discharge characteristics. Magnetic  eld topology of the thruster is exam-ined to determine the proper location of a LaB6 hollow cathode, which is also designed andbuilt at BUSTLab.

This cathode is larger than the original version developed at JPLthat has operated successfully for years in the H6 Hall thruster at dischargecurrents up to 60 A. The cathode has a 1.3 cm OD by 2.5 cm long LaB6 insert, andhas been labeled nominally the 1.5 cm diameter cathode. This cathode has beensuccessfully operated in test facilities that simulate the axial thruster magnetic fieldconfiguration in the cathode region. The cathode was run over the full dischargecurrent range of 6 to 35 A and 6.4 to 19.65 sccm xenon gas flow rate required for thethruster for the ARRM mission concept, and has also successfully operated in theHERMeS TDU-2 Hall thruster up to the full power operating conditions of 12.5 kW,600 W and 2800 s.

2480,AIAA-2016-4641,Aerothermodynamic Benefits of Mixed Exhaust Turbofans,"The preference for mixed exhaust turbofan installations in corporate, regional, and in some commercial airliners is primarily because of the claimed improvement in thrust and specific fuel consumption (SFC) with mixing. This improvement (2 to 3%) has been demonstrated in prior component tests of mixed exhaust configurations in powered wind tunnels. This paper presents back-to-back whole engine cycle studies of both mixed exhaust and separate exhaust turbofans with design bypass pass ratios (BPR) of 4, 6, 7, and 8 toward predicting the improvement for the whole engine system. For all configurations modeled the top of climb (TOC,35000¡¯/0.80) net thrust (FN) was kept constant (9000 lb) resulting in different core sizes and fan diameters for the clean sheet designs. The model calculations included propulsive efficiency, core efficiency, thermal efficiency, and transmission efficiency. Comparison between mixed exhaust and separate exhaust configurations with the same design BPR showed an altitude SFC advantage with mixed exhaust designs up to a design BPR of 7 (2 to 3% for BPR of 4-6), primarily resulting from a higher transmission efficiency. However, for design BPR of 8 the mixed exhaust design showed worse SFC than the separate exhaust turbofan. Also, a comparison of gross thrust (FG) was made at the off-design condition of sea level take-off (SLTO) when both models were run to the same fuel flow. Again the mixed exhaust design showed a higher gross thrust up to a design BPR of 7, and a loss in thrust for a design BPR of 8. The improvement with mixing ( 1 to 2% in FG) has been attributed to higher mixed temperature upstream of the common nozzle as explained in the paper. In addition to the back-to-back cycle study, a stand alone MATLAB model of the mixer/nozzle was constructed requiring as input the entering separate stream properties available from cycle data. Calculations of the stand alone model showed a similar trend as the cycle model results. The reason for the decrease in performance with mixing for BPR of 8 has been attributed to both reduced mixed gas temperature upstream of the common nozzle and increased mixer pressure loss from increased mixer Mach number. Literature on experimental and numerical investigations of mixer designs toward improving mixer pressure loss while achieving the required mixing effectiveness is listed.","Aerothermodynamic Benefits of Mixed Exhaust Turbofans "

2483,AIAA-2016-5024,Transient Thermal Analysis of the 12.5 kW HERMeS Hall Thruster,"NASA¡¯s Dawn spacecraft entered orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres on March 6, 2015 thereby becoming the first mission to orbit two celestial bodies outside of the Earth-moon system. This feat was made possible due to the use of electric propulsion (EP) to provide the 11 km/s of delta-V that was necessary. This type of propulsion is also enabling for many of NASA¡¯s future missions, such as the proposed Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM). Specifically, the Hall Effect Rocket with Magnetic Shielding (HERMeS) is the propulsive design baseline due to its long operational lifetime and high specific impulse. Extensive modeling is required to verify the thruster's predicted thermal performance and survival during the bounding mission phases. Since the thruster would constrain plasma on the order of tens of thousands of hours, components in the thruster must be able to accommodate much higher sustained temperatures than typical spacecraft hardware. Furthermore, the high temperatures necessitate care in analyzing thermal gradients within the thruster. In this paper, we describe a thermal model of the HERMeS thruster and focus upon the thruster's transient performance under different initial firing conditions. The thruster's transient thermal response is critical to verify margin in the thermal stresses inherent in the thruster and to determine safe start-up procedures to protect the thruster's critical components. This model is used to perform transient thermal analysis of the thruster during startup and shutdown, provide temperature maps for structural analysis, and plan for thermal cycle testing conducted at JPL. The thermal cycle testing includes thruster starts at the cold temperature limits and operation at maximum expected external heat flux. This work will support laboratory environmental testing of the HERMeS thruster, which is being conducted at JPL in 2016.","Transient Thermal Analysis of the 12.5 kW HERMeS Hall "
2484,AIAA-2016-4740,Mass Spectrometry of Selected Ionic Liquids in Capillary Electrospray at Nanoliter Volumetric Flow Rates,"Capillary-based electrospray thrusters allow user-enabled control of the volumetric flow rate of the propellant. This control, coupled with mass spectrometry techniques spanning a large mass-to-charge range, enables elucidation of the composition of the electrospray beam and through further analyses, a better understanding of the physics occurring at the liquid/vacuum interface. In this work, mass spectra of selected ionic liquids electrosprayed from a capillary emitter are measured, using time-of-flight mass spectrometry, over a wide range of volumetric flow rates. The time-of-flight mass spectrometer enables simultaneous acquisition over a mass-to-charge range of 20 amu/q to ~500,000 amu/q in a single pulse cycle. Additionally, the use of orthogonal extraction enables direct determination of the kinetic energies of ions present in the electrosprayed beam. The presented data reveal a complex emission process occurring for ionic liquid capillary-based electrospray at nanoliter volumetric flow rates. The electrospray beam mass-to-charge composition includes a sequence of singly-charged ions and doubly-charged ions at nearly all sampled flow rates for all electrosprayed ionic liquids. In addition to the small ion-clusters, two Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions from approximately 10,000 amu/q to 500,000 amu/q exist in the spectra each with mass-to-charge distribution sensitive to the volumetric flow rate. The volumetric flow rate dependence of the largest charge-to-mass ratio droplets appears to be consistent with previously measured scaling laws, although exhibiting a wide mass-to-charge distribution. The flow rate dependence of the lower mass-to-charge distribution is more complex and is discussed in some detail. Measurement of the time-of-flight mass spectrum for a number of different ion kinetic energy defects over a number of different volumetric flow rates results in a more thorough understanding of kinetic energy losses experienced in the jet structure of the Taylor cone, with direct impacts to the thrust performance of these types of devices. The appearance of these ions and distributions alter the thought on the emission mechanism at work in the electrospray system. No longer is electrospray defined and easily explained by the Iribarne emission mechanism and droplet generation by the Rayleigh instability.","Mass Spectrometry of Selected Ionic Liquids in Capillary "

It was found that the propellant decomposes at 165 oC on titanium, which is the decomposition temperature of HAN. The onset temperature for decomposition on platinum was 85 oC and on rhenium it was 125 oC. This suggests that platinum and rhenium act as catalysts for the decomposition of the monopropellant. From the experimental data, Arrhenius-type reaction rate parameters were calculated. The activation energy for platinum was 3 times less than that of titanium suggesting it could be a prime choice for catalyst material in further thruster development.","Decomposition of a Double Salt Ionic Liquid "
2489,AIAA-2016-4579,Linear Burn Rates of Monopropellants for Multi-Mode Micropropulsion,"Multi-mode micropropulsion is a potential game-changing technology enabling rapidly composable small satellites with unprecedented mission flexibility. Maximum mission flexibility requires propellant that is shared between the chemical and electric propulsion systems. Previous research has identified a promising monopropellant that is both readily catalytically exothermically decomposed (chemical mode) and electrosprayable (electric mode). In this work the linear burn rate of this monopropellant is determined to aid design of the microtube catalytic chemical thruster. A pressurized fixed volume reactor is used to determine the linear burn rate. Benchmark experiments use a 13 molar mixture of hydroxylammonium nitrate and water, and show agreement to within 5% of literature data. The multi-mode monopropellant is a double-salt ionic liquid consisting of 41% 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate and 59% hydroxylammonium nitrate by mass. At the design pressure of 1.5 MPa the linear burn rate of this propellant used for designing the muli-mode propulsion system is 22.8 mm/s. Based on this result, the minimum flow rate required is 0.25 mg/s for a feed tube with a 0.1 mm inner diameter and 2500 mg/s for a feed tube with a 10 mm inner diameter.","Linear Burn Rates of Monopropellants for Multi-Mode "

In propellant tank forartificial satellite and future on-orbit spacecraft, sloshing due to disturbance and settlingbehavior by change of acceleration have to be understood for design of propellant supplysystem and attitude control system. These fluid behaviors in mg are affected by a dynamicwetting significantly, therefore it is important to understand dynamic wetting dominatedfluid behavior. We observed fluid behaviors in cylindrical containers in microgravityconditions created by drop tower facility, and effect of viscosity and diameter of container onfluid behaviors were investigated.

During the experimental campaignwith di erent transparent injectors (L/D, contraction ratio, nozzle length), nucleation en-hancing internal ow regimes like cavitation and even hydraulic ip were detected.

GAP is one of the High Energy Materials (HEMs) and not so toxic, compared with N2H4. However, it is known that GAP generates carbonaceous residues at its combustion. Combustion residues can cause low propulsion performance of a thruster. To use GAP as a liquid monopropellant, it is necessary to decrease combustion residue. In general, the promotion of the combustion can be expected by the spray combustion. Therefore we consider spraying GAP in the chamber to promote the combustion. However, the combustion characteristics of spraying GAP are not clear. In this study, we obtained the relationships among the spray droplet diameters and C* combustion efficiency and the carbonaceous residues. As a result, by decreasing a mean droplet diameter from 38 ¦Ìm to 23 ¦Ìm, the amount of carbonaceous residues decreases from 11% to 8% and the C* combustion efficiency increases from 82% to 95%.","Combustion Characteristics of GAP for the Liquid "

Historically, only HEU reactors were considered for NTP due to need ofminimum mass systems and the common perception that HEU nuclear cores will alwaysmake smaller reactors than LEU cores. However, recent studies have shown LEU NTPsystems can be created to enable human Mars missions. These studies do not show theperformance losses or gains when using an LEU system rather than an HEU system. Thegoal of this paper is to present four optimized NTP systems designed for the same 16,000lbs-f thrust, with a combination of minimum mass and high speci c impulse. The fourdesigns di er in the nuclear fuel type; two contain a carbide composite fuel that is derivedfrom historical experiments and two contain tungsten cermet fuel, which has become agood fuel choice given advances in manufacturing techniques. Within each fuel type, LEUor HEU will be used.

This paper willfocus on the accurate prediction of the peak pressure transients due to the reflected pressurewave. During the priming of a spacecraft propulsion system, pressure transients occur fromthe rapid deceleration of propellant from a pressurized manifold to an evacuated manifolddownstream of an isolation valve. When the isolation valve is opened, propellant will flowessentially unrestrained until the fluid column impacts a surge suppression device. In thecase of a straight edged orifice this will cause cavitation which will in turn slow down thefluid column. The propellant will continue to flow through the downstream piping until ithits a dead end. The initial impact of the fluid column with the dead end will cause apressure transient. This transient will be referred to as ¡°slug hammer¡±. Once the linebecomes liquid full, another pressure transient will occur which will cause a pressure waveto attenuate through all of the wetted lines. This transient will be referred to as the¡°reflected pressure wave¡±. Surge suppression devices have the greatest effect on reducingthe pressure transient due to slug hammer. Therefore it is important to accurately predictthe pressure transient due to the reflected pressure wave, as this transient cannot bemitigated as effectively by simply adding additional margin. AFT Impulse, asurge/waterhammer modeling software, was shown to accurately predict the peak pressuretransient due to the reflected pressure wave despite some of its modeling limitations, as longas the peak pressure transient is due to the reflected pressure wave.","Analytical Prediction of Peak Pressure Transients "

Unique features of this design include use of mechanical cryocoolers instead of cryogens and measurement of the heat load with a calibrated heat conduction rod. The calorimeter is operational and has completed its first test series. The initial test series was designed to look for differences in performance between a single layer of aluminum foil and a sheet of double aluminized Mylar (DAM). Although it has been speculated that the aluminum foil would perform better, since the aluminum coating on the Mylar might not be thick enough to stop the transmission of long wave length infrared radiation, our testing showed a higher heat load for the aluminum foil than the DAM. The aluminum foil showed a heat load of 132 mW at an 87 K outer temperature and 152 mW at a 107K outer temperature, whereas the DAM showed a heat load of 66 mW at an 88 K outer temperature and 81 mW at 108 K.","Design and Operation of a Calorimeter for Advanced "

To leverage the reduction potential a more profoundunderstanding of combustion noise formation and suitable predictive tools are needed. Inthe framework of the EU FP7 RECORD program a hybrid CFD/CAA methodology wasapplied on a generic premixed combustor test case in order to demonstrate its capabilitiesfor combustion noise predictions. The method is based on reactive RANS simulations whichfeed the mean ow  eld and combustion noise sources into an acoustic solver based on theLinearized Navier Stokes equations (LNSE). The combustion noise sources are obtainedfrom a spectral model of the uctuating heat release. In this paper  rst cold and reactingRANS mean ow are compared with experimental PIV measurements. Comparing withexperimental data good agreement is found in the cold ow case whereas some deviationsof the mean and rms-values are seen in the core region of the hot ow cases. The RANSsimulation data are post processed with a statistical noise model which yields a frequency-dependent combustion noise source term. In the  nal step acoustic simulations using thespectral combustion noise source term are carried out in frequency domain. The resultsare in good agreement with the experimental pressure spectrum for two of three operatingpoints. It is found that the magnitude of the combustion noise is excellently predicted bythe noise model and the frequency decay is qualitatively captured in the low frequencyrange.

Although more burned gas exists in front of the detonation wave as thenozzle interval increases, it does not affect the propagation velocity under the premixedC2H4 + 3O2 gas injection. The velocity decrease is observed under the conditions thatC2H4 and O2 are separately injected; adjacent and non-adjacent gas injections. The lowtemperaturearea and the incomplete combustion of C2H4 are generated behind thedetonation wave, and the insufficient mixing with fuel and oxidizer would be one of thekey factors for the velocity decrease. However, CJ velocity theoretically calculated fromthe mass of burned C2H4 becomes larger than the propagation velocity. Then, theburned gas in front of the detonation wave is also investigated through the cases for thenon-premixed gas injection. The velocity decrease and the amount of burned gas in frontof the detonation wave are restrained when the nozzle interval becomes smaller, so theeffect of burned gas in front of the detonation wave on the velocity decrease for the nonpremixedgas injection is confirmed. This relationship is not observed in the comparisonof the adjacent and the non-adjacent injections, and further study is needed to clarifythe difference between the mechanisms for velocity decrease in these two injectionconditions.","N "

Governing equations are twodimensionaleuler equations with reduced kinetic reaction model. The length of the injectionwall is fixed at 40 mm and curvature is changed as a parameter. Moreover, injection gas isstoichiometric premixed gas and non-premixed gas. The following knowledge is obtainedthrough the calculation. The pressure at the detonation front becomes gradually smaller inlarger curvature. It affects the height of the injected propellants to be smaller. Propagationvelocity decrease occurs at the larger curvature, and this tendency does not depend on theinjection method. The degree of this effect is larger in the non-premixed injection cases.Furthermore, the whole region analysis is conducted to confirm the effect of periodicboundary. The results are different from the cases of using periodic boundary, and similarphenomenon is observed in the experiments.","D "

2511,AIAA-2016-5635,New State Transition Matrices for Relative Motion of Spacecraft Formations in Perturbed Orbits,"This paper presents new state transition matrices that model the relative motion of twospacecraft in arbitrarily eccentric orbits perturbed by J2 and di erential drag for threestate de nitions based on relative orbital elements. These matrices are derived by  rstperforming a Taylor expansion on the equations of relative motion including all consideredperturbations and subsequently computing an exact, closed-form solution of the resultinglinear di erential equations. Both density-model-speci c and density-model-free di eren-tial drag formulations are included. Density-model-speci c formulations require a-prioriknowledge of the atmosphere, while density-model-free formulations remove this require-ment by augmenting the relative state with a set of parameters which are estimated inight. The resulting state transition matrices are used to generalize the geometric in-terpretation of the e ects of J2 and di erential drag on relative motion in near-circularorbits provided in previous works to arbitrarily eccentric orbits. Additionally, this paperharmonizes current literature by demonstrating that a number of state transition matricesderived by previous authors using various techniques can be found by subjecting the mod-els presented in this paper to more restrictive assumptions. Finally, the presented statetransition matrices are validated through comparison with a high- delity numerical orbitpropagator. It is found that the models including density-model-free di erential drag ex-hibit much better performance than their density-model-speci c counterparts.

When the relative motion is adequately characterized by first order theorysuch as the linear Clohessy-Wiltshire model and analytic solution, the six relative orbitalelements describe the location and size of the instantaneous in-the-plane ellipse, theangular position around the ellipse, and the out-of-plane amplitude and angular position.These elements are explicitly relatable to the six rectangular position and velocitycoordinates. Second order theories, such as the Quadratic Volterra model and analyticsolution, become necessary when the close-proximity assumption is violated. Two distincttheories for (quasi) second order relative orbital element sets are explored. One theoryuses the expanded solution form and introduces several instantaneous sub-ellipses withcorresponding element sub-sets totaling twenty-one individual elements. Overall motionis described by a linear combination of the sub-ellipses. Another theory uses thecompacted solution form and introduces a single instantaneous ellipse withcorresponding element set totaling nine individual elements. In each case, the theoryquantifies distortion of the first order relative orbital elements when including secondorder effects. The new variables are described as quasi elements because they form a nonminimalset of coordinates, and hence can not be constructed as output from a generaltransformation having a six-dimensional state epoch input, without knowledge of theapproximate analytic solution. Several examples are presented, both analytically andnumerically.

2518,AIAA-2016-5235,Beyond âMan in a Canâ? Designing Small In-Space Human Vehicles for Mission and Program Requirements,"The concept of a small, maneuverable spacecraft for one or two people has been proposed for a numberof missions and applications, dating back to Wernher von Braun in the 1950¡¯s. Prior studies of the publishedliterature was unable to find a single instance where the concept was ever taken beyond ¡°viewgraph¡±-level visuals.In general, this category of small 1-2 person spacecraft has gotten short shrift in mission architectures;whether it is due to lack of applicable prior flight experience or the dismissive nature of the ¡°man in a can¡±label is impossible to say. This paper looks at the generic category of small human spacecraft for microgravityoperations, in the context of both maintenance and servicing of space systems and of microgravity explorationsof solar system minor bodies such as asteroids, comets, or the moons of Mars. Critical mission performanceparameters are identified, such as distance from base (in terms of both transit time and Dv), duration of sortie,and required operations (in terms of required reach and dexterity). In parallel, fundamental design choicesare identified, such as number of crew, use of multiple vehicles for safety, and provision of robotic and/or EVAcapabilities. Comparative details for the canonical reference designs include size of crew (1-3), sortie duration(hours-days), dexterity (robotic, external manual manipulation, full EVA support), and maneuvering performance(Dv). The goal of this analysis is to determine the effect of mission specifications on the preferred choicesin vehicle configuration. For example, probabilistic risk analysis shows that vehicle failures can occur whichvariously threaten crew survival immediately (e.g., life support system failure) or longer-term (e.g., propulsionsystem failure). Response to these contingencies may include deployment of a second small spacecraft as arescue vehicle, or designing sorties to always have two vehicles capable of mutual support and crew rescue atneed. Other options considered include the provision of operational or contingency (¡°bail-out¡±) space suits,with or without independent translation flight systems embedded. Results indicate that concatenations of multiplevehicles and safety systems can drive the loss of crew probability to arbitrarily low values, but at theprice of increased mission mass and the cost for developing and deploying additional systems. Results to dateindicate that this category of small ¡°space utility vehicles¡± (SUVs) offer real advantages in terms of the rangeand complexity of mission objectives, while minimizing the chance of loss of crew as compared to conventionalEVA sorties. There are also advantages in terms of required denitrogenation times and overall mission performancein both spacecraft servicing and minor body exploration activities. The appropriate next step will be todevelop and test a complete SUV concept in functional neutral buoyancy operations.","Beyond ¡°Man in a Can¡±: Designing Small In-Space"

Software automation has been used to good effect in managing some of these challenges to control single robotic systems, even multi-functional systems, in previous unmanned missions without the physical presence of human operators. However, these previous control software artifacts tend to be platform-specific, single-system-focused and not really applicable to multi-agent teams of multi-functional, multi-generational robotic systems. In this paper, we discuss a software architecture based on the Multi-Agent Distributed Adaptive Resource Allocation1 (MADARA) and Group Autonomy for Mobile Systems2 (GAMS) open source middleware projects that is intended to be deployed in a multi-agent, multi-functional robotic system called the Keck Institute for Space Studies Multi-Planetary Smart Tile.

These arrays lured many designers and manufacturers to integrate them as part of themodern systems because of their fascinating features like high speed of rotation, dynamic beamforming andlightweight. Therefore, the arrays were implemented in deep space communication systems, tracking radarsand high accuracy medical equipments. Despite the arrays superior features, they suffer from the sidelobes.These sidelobes are potential sources for unwanted signals that interfere with the desired source. Hence, theresearchers, scholars and designers worked hardly to mitigate the deteriorating effect of the sidelobes. Theirefforts were divided into either inventing new sampling windows with lower sidelobe levels (tapering), ormodifying the array geometry, or optimizing the array weights for high mainlobe to sidelobe level or simplyinducing a null in the direction of interference. Unfortunately, these solutions were temporary, or sometimesexpensive, or need high computation power or may deform the original mainlobe leading to an increaseSignal to Interference Ratio (SIR).","A Novel Algorithm to Eliminate the Sidelobes for any Planar "

2533,AIAA-2016-5587,Economics and Food Provision Options for Luxury Food in an Orbiting Space Hotel,"The near term increase in space access, combined with the technological development ofhabitat technologies, will result in a market for vacations to space hotels. Like air travel inthe last century, costs to orbit will initially allow only the wealthy to travel to orbiting, likelypartially inflatable, habitats for short stays. These initial space hotel tourists will providerevenue for later, more broad efforts. Such customers will not be happy with protein barsand reconstitutes. They will expect menus of fresh foods, preferably high quality diversemenus, with a wide variety of options. As a result, a series of trade-offs between supply offoods to orbit, versus supply from orbiting farms, versus grown on site, will need to be made.In order to determine trade-offs, menus, will have to be decomposed into elements that canbe sourced in orbit from other habitats, in the hotel's own gardens/farms/machinery, andfrom Earth. Machinery may include synthesis using yeasts or accumulative manufacture,but it is core to this paper that most elements and entrees will be grown and harvested, thenprovided fresh, frozen, or dried and processed.

A Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG) could offer space missions a more efficientpower system that uses one fourth of the nuclear fuel and decreases the thermal footprintcompared to the current state of the art. The Stirling Cycle Technology Development(SCTD) Project is funded by the RPS Program to developing Stirling-based subsystems,including convertors and controller maturation efforts that have resulted in high fidelityhardware like the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG), Advanced StirlingConvertor (ASC), and ASC Controller Unit (ACU). The SCTD Project also performsresearch to develop less mature technologies with a wide variety of objectives, includingincreasing temperature capability to enable new environments, improving system reliabilityor fault tolerance, reducing mass or size, and developing advanced concepts that are missionenabling. Active vibration reduction systems (AVRS), or ¡°balancers¡±, have historically beendeveloped and characterized to provide fault tolerance for generator designs thatincorporate dual-opposed Stirling convertors or enable single convertor, or small RPS,missions. Balancers reduce the dynamic disturbance forces created by the power piston anddisplacer internal moving components of a single operating convertor to meet spacecraftrequirements for induced disturbance force. To improve fault tolerance for dual-opposedconfigurations and enable single convertor configurations, a breadboard AVRS wasimplemented on the Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC). The AVRS included a linearmotor, a motor mount, and a closed-loop controller able to balance out the transmitted peakdynamic disturbance using acceleration feedback. Test objectives included quantifyingpower and mass penalty and reduction in transmitted force over a range of ASC operatingparameters and mounting conditions. All tests were performed at three different pistonamplitudes, 3.0 mm, 3.75 mm, and 4.5 mm. Overall, the transmitted force was reduced to2% of the total unbalanced force by actively balancing out only the first fundamentalfrequency, with balancer motor power remaining under one watt. The test results will beused to guide future balancer designs.","Active Vibration Reduction of the Advanced Stirling "
2535,AIAA-2016-5016,Improving Power Density of Free-Piston Stirling Engines,"Analyses and experiments demonstrate the potential benefits of optimizing piston and displacer motion in a free-piston Stirling Engine. Isothermal analysis shows the theoretical limits of power density improvement due to ideal motion in ideal Stirling engines. More realistic models based on nodal analysis show that ideal piston and displacer waveforms are not optimal, often producing less power than engines that use sinusoidal piston and displacer motion. Constrained optimization using nodal analysis predicts that Stirling engine power density can be increased by as much as 58% using optimized higher harmonic piston and displacer motion. An experiment is conducted in which an engine designed for sinusoidal motion is forced to operate with both second and third harmonics, resulting in a piston power increase of as much as 14%. Analytical predictions are compared to experimental data and show close agreement with indirect thermodynamic power calculations, but poor agreement with direct electrical power measurements.","1 "

2538,AIAA-2016-5019,Dry (CO2) Reformation of Methane using Nickel-Barium Catalyst,"Methane and CO2 produced from natural gas wells and biogas plants are potentially efficient for dry reforming to syngas mixture consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This can help with CO2 management, provide energy and also serve as a precursor to chemical and liquid fuel production. Syngas produced from dry reforming combined with steam reforming can result in optimal molar ratio of 2 for Fisher-Tropsch synthesis compared to any other reforming processes. Enhanced catalytic conversion using Ni based catalysts provide economic performance but can result in deactivation due to carbon deposition and sintering which calls for modification or promotion of the catalyst. In this paper, the effects of adding alkali barium to Ni-alumina catalyst are investigated to determine the potential of enhanced stability at high conversion. Presence of 2% Ba maintained conversion values similar to Ni catalyst along with reduction of carbon deposition. Addition of Ba revealed reduction in carbon deposition and its effect was not directly proportional to barium content as seen from the results with the addition of up to 4% Ba. Addition of Ba enhanced CO2 conversion and reduced activation energy of CH4 and CO2 but excess (4%) addition of Ba caused significant decrease in conversion and increased activation energy due to the loss of Ni particle dispersion.","Dry (CO2) Reformation of Methane using Nickel-Barium "

2544,AIAA-2016-4914,Numerical Study of Decreasing the Spread of Sarin (GB) in an Air-conditioned Aircraft Cabin,"they are cheap, relatively accessible, and easy to transport. A skilled chemist can readily synthesize most chemical agents if the precursors are available. Chemical warfare (CW) is different from the use of conventional weapons or nuclear weapons because the destructive effects of chemical weapons are not primarily due to any explosive force. Chemical warfare involves using the toxic properties of chemical substances as weapons. Discovery of nerve agents in Germany led to the availability of a class of compounds at least one order of magnitude more lethal than previously known where death might occur in a matter of minutes instead of hours. Nerve agent refers to two groups of highly toxic chemical compounds that generally are organic esters of substituted phosphoric acid (G-agents, V-agents). The three most active G-agents are tabun, (Chemical Agent Symbol GA), Sarin (GB), CH3POFOCH (CH3); and Soman (GD).The G-agent liquids under ordinary atmospheric conditions have sufficiently high volatility to permit dissemination in vapour form. They are generally colourless, odourless or nearly so, and are readily absorbable through not only the lungs and eyes but also the skin and intestinal tract without producing any irritation or other sensation on the part of the exposed individual. These agents are sufficiently potent so that even a brief exposure may be fatal. Death may occur in 1¨C10 min, or be delayed for 1¨C2 h depending on the concentration of the agent. The objective of this paper is to study the best ventilation system with both Under-Floor Displacement and personalized ventilation (PV) with GB injection in the aircraft cabin of the economy section of a Boeing 767 airplane during cruise and passengers protection by air curtain design for both steady and transient states. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling techniques using the ANSYS FLUENT 15.0 package solved the continuity, momentum, energy, and species transport equations, in addition to k-¦Å model equations for turbulence closure. Mesh sizes used in the present work exceeded 6,000,000 mesh volumes in one case. GB mole fraction, temperature, velocity Contours are obtained to realize the air curtain performance for the optimum passengers protection. Air curtain is good for preventing spread of GB, but of course increase temperature and decrease thermal comfort inside the aircraft cabin because of the higher velocity, so it is used only for emergency cases until the aircraft landed.","Numerical Study of Limiting the Spread of Sarin (GB) in an Air-"

2546,AIAA-2016-4556,Integration of a Turbine Stage Optimizer into Engine Simulation Utilizing Numerical Propulsion System Simulation,"The development of a turbine stage optimizer integrated into an engine simulation ispresented. The practice of optimizing individual turbine blades or stages for incorporationinto aircraft engines is widespread and often accepted as standard practice. Though thisoptimization method may produce an optimal turbine blade or stage for a given objectivefunction, it may not yield the optimal engine performance as the effect of the optimizedturbine on the engine as a whole is not taken into account during the optimization process.To address this concern, a turbine stage optimizer is incorporated into an engine simulationprogram in which the objective function of the optimizer is defined by the engineperformance rather than the turbine performance. An F100 equivalent engine was modeledin the propulsion simulation software Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS). Athree-dimensional turbine stage optimizer utilizing an evolutionary algorithm and a viscousflow solver was integrated into the engine simulation to optimize the high and low pressureturbines. The turbines optimized within the engine simulation software produced a 1.4%increase in thrust and a 1.5% decrease in TSFC of the F100 equivalent engine, whereas theturbines optimized independently did not allow for the afterburner to achieve its desired exittemperature, resulting in a 6.7% decrease in thrust and a 12.6% decrease in TSFC of theF100 equivalent engine. Results indicate turbine stages optimized independently of an enginemay adversely affect other engine components when integrated into the engine, leading todetrimental engine performance.","Integration of a Turbine Stage Optimizer into Engine "
2547,AIAA-2016-4557,Assessment of the Boundary Layer within a Rotating Detonation Combustor,"This paper presents a fast numerical model to predict the convective heat flux released within rotating detonation combustors. This reduced model requires a few seconds to run in a Quad-core I7 laptop, delivering comparable results to the more computationally expensive two-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes solver. The reduced model is coupled with an integral boundary layer method to predict the boundary layer thickness, and using correlations predict the convective heat transfer coefficient. Consequently, the bulk and the local heat flux rate can be quickly estimated for different operating conditions. The largest time-averaged heat flux is located at the triple point , where the high heat flux behind the detonation front is cooled by a mixture of H2-air, within the refilling zone. The model shows that the heat flux within the combustor is highly sensitive to the inlet total pressure, and less dependence on the mixture inlet temperature.

The most commonly used techniques involve drilling opticalaccess holes in the engine casing for probes to directly monitor blade deflection and vibration.In this work, a less intrusive, indirect technique for rotor blade fault detection is developed.The method utilizes the signal from an accelerometer attached to a stationary, stator-likeprobe located just downstream of the rotor system. The vibration of the stator was processedto determine the relative locations of the vibratory peaks, which are assumed to be directlyrelated to the relative locations of the rotor blades. The current study shows that the resultingstator vibrations indeed contain rotor blade location information, similar to the blade tiptiming information gathered from a non-contact stress measurement system. Statisticalanalysis of the vibratory peak location data was used to identify one type of seeded blade fault(an intentionally offset blade). The seeded offset amplitude and the seeded offset blade rotorposition were varied to determine the effectiveness of the fault detection algorithm. The resultsshow that the fault detection technique is able to detect the presence, rotor position, andchange in offset amplitude of the offset blades.","Rotor Blade Fault Detection through Statistical Analysis of "

The simulation includes transient thermal boundary conditions and rotational speeds according to a simplified flight mission of an aero engine. The heat pipe is modeled as a solid cylinder with a high temperature dependent thermal conductivity. In previous studies the structural effects of a heat pipe inserted inside a turbine disk have been discussed in terms of temperature and stress influences. In this paper, the damage parameter by the Smith Watson and Topper method ???? is used for life prediction until technical cracking can be expected. Several high loaded areas in the disk have been identified and evaluated. Furthermore, a parameter study regarding different heat inputs at the outer radius of the disk is presented. The results show that the heat pipe does not reduce the durability of the disk. The stress peaks in the heat pipe cavity are not critical.

By means of CFD simulations the passive heating performance of the igniter concept, as well as the auto-ignition process, is evaluated. Depending on the degree of thermal insulation of the resonator these calculations predict ignition to occur within milliseconds of operation. Igniter prototypes with a nominal thermal power of 4.5 and 30 kW are implemented using additive manufacturing. Coldflow tests demonstrate considerable heating for a wide range of operating conditions without adapting the nozzle-resonator-spacing to the nozzle pressure ratio. For the larger configuration successful ignition is achieved with feed pressures below 2 MPa, demonstrating the viability of the igniter concept.

2564,AIAA-2016-4888,Engine Design Attributes Relative to HEU and LEU Core Approaches for a Small Thrust NTP,"If human exploration missions across the Solar System are to become common place we need transportation technol-ogies that reduce the time of flight, create a mass efficient vehicle, and effectively use current and envisioned launch systems to reduce mission risk and cost. Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) is a proven technology that provides the performance to enable rapid transit due to its high specific impulse. Future human Mars exploration could have sub-stantial benefits in terms of lower mission mass and shorter in-space mission time when NTP is employed. Making the human crewed vehicle as small as technically feasible will permit optimization of the NTP system to lower thrust levels with little or no mass penalty to the spacecraft. This permits the NTP design to have a smaller reactor and pre-sent a smaller, more affordable development and operational footprint to reduce unit cost and testing cost. Aerojet Rocketdyne¡¯s (AR) multidisciplinary design analysis capability has shown in past studies that a cluster of smaller thrust (e.g., <25,000 pounds) NTP systems can successfully meet mission requirements and provide engine-out ca-pability for reduced Mars human mission risk. NTP has been proven scientifically and many engineering challenges have been addressed in past ground testing of the larger reactor cores. Recently, mission architecture experts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have been extensively re-examining the requirements for getting cargo and crew to Mars. NTP, if used for crew, has been shown to reduce the number of launches and provide some risk reduction for the crew by reducing the duration of the transits to and from Mars. The challenge today is to create an affordable, highly robust NTP system for space travel. It is AR¡¯s belief that this could be achieved using smaller reactors, and multiple, moderate thrust-level designs for the NTP system.","Engine Design Attributes Relative to HEU and LEU Core Approaches for a "
2565,AIAA-2016-4563,Thermal Cycling for Development of Hybrid Fuel for a Notional Mars Ascent Vehicle,"A Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) would be a critical part of a potential Mars sample return campaign. As currently envisioned, the MAV would launch samples from Mars into Mars orbit. Challenging requirements would be placed on a MAV as it would need to be able to survive in the harsh Martian environment which can get as cold as -120¡ãC in the winter. At these cold temperatures, survival heating could be necessary to keep the MAV within the allowable flight temperature range. Estimates for survival heating power show that a fuel capable of operating at low temperature would significantly reduce the total required energy of the MAV. This has led to consideration of a hybrid propulsion system due to its anticipated low temperature capability. A new wax-based fuel, SP7, has been developed for a notional MAV mission. Thermal modeling of the fuel in the Mars environment was completed in order to estimate the temperature response of the fuel during Mars diurnal temperature cycling. Preliminary thermal testing was conducted to determine the max temperature range, radial gradient, and ramp rate the fuel could tolerate without cracking. The modeling and preliminary testing was used to develop a comprehensive, 100-day thermal cycling campaign. A total of 200 cycles are planned that are representative of 200 Martian diurnal cycles, roughly one-third of a Martian year. After 150 cycles, the fuel samples show no signs of cracking that would jeopardize the rocket¡¯s performance.

2568,AIAA-2016-4752,Experimental and Analytical Investigation of Effect of Pressure on Regression Rate of Axial-Injection End-Burning Hybrid Rockets,"The regression characteristics of axial-injection end-burning hybrid rocket (EBHR) fuels having numerous small ports were experimentally investigated for the first time using a laboratory scale motor. In this paper, three requirements for EBHR fuel grains are explained in detail. High accuracy 3D printing allows for the production of fuel that satisfies the requirements for EBHR as defined in this paper. A data reduction method that overcomes the problem of multiple solutions to the c* equation is used to determine fuel regression rate with less than 10% error. Results of fifteen static firings tests show that fuel regression rate increases as the chamber pressure increases, which agrees with the trend revealed in previous studies (pressure exponent n is close to unity). No difference in combustion characteristics was found by comparing results of multi-port and single port fuel firing tests conducted in this and previous studies. A fuel regression model based on the Granular Diffusion Flame (GDF) model and Matthew and Frederick¡¯s method is developed to investigate regression characteristics. Results calculated with this model agree with experimentally observed values, as well as the results calculated by Matthew and Frederick. However, this does hold true in tests with varying oxidizer port velocity. A GDF model only takes into account solid propellant regression, neglecting the effects of oxidizer velocity, and is shown in this study to be inappropriate for evaluating EBHR regression characteristics.","Experimental and Analytical Investigation of          "

Inthis paper, attention has been paid to trajectory evolution of debris in low Earth orbitand geosynchronous orbit regions. One of the forces e ecting the trajectory of a spacedebris is the Lorentz force, which acts when a charged body moves through the Earth'smagnetosphere. Because of continuous bombardment of plasma particles, a space debris isoften subject to charging. Correct modeling of Lorentz force requires correct modeling ofmagnetosphere and the body charge, which in turn depends on correct modeling of bodycurrents, space-plasma environment and body capacitance.","Space Debris Charging and its E?ect on Orbit"

This improvement allows the method to be applied with confidence to highly inclined orbits and special cases such as sun-synchronous orbits where the inclusion of the effects of atmospheric oblateness and the diurnal bulge will be particularly significant. These improvements can be applied to any general perturbations model for lifetime analysis. Using a case study of a sun-synchronous satellite a comparison is drawn between the original and improved methods, showing that by capturing the effects of a non-spherically-symmetrical atmosphere the orbit lifetime predicted could be up to 7% longer or 10% shorter than when using the spherically-symmetrical model. Also notable is the difference between the orbit lifetime predictions made using the spherically-symmetrical model derived from different data sets; for the case study this was approximately a third of the orbit lifetime.","General Perturbations Method for Orbit Lifetime Analysis "

A detailed mechanism of CH4, 33 chemical species and 150 re-actions, is efficiently and directly introduced.

The result, with a at inlet pro le, interestingly shows thegeneration of an unstable combustion mode, which is not observed with a smooth inlet pro- le. It is shown that the disappearance of non-premixed ames behind the GOX post is atrigger for the unstable combustion mode through the production of partly premixed gasesand the generation of autoignition at several locations in the combustion chamber, whichmay be caused by the extent of the incursion of GCH4 and GOX jets in the recirculationregion behind the GOX post.","Generations of unstable combustion in a non-premixed"

2586,AIAA-2016-5463,Influence of Transient Heat Transfer on Metabolic Functions of Chlorella Vulgaris used for Environmental Control and Life Support Systems of Long Duration Spaceflight,"Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) systems designed for long durationmissions to Mars or distant asteroids must be robust and require minimal resupply ofconsumables. As a result, long duration missions may require ECLS subsystems with multiplefunctions to reduce launch mass and extend mission duration. Recently, the Water Walls LifeSupport Architecture (WWLSA) has been proposed as an alternative to current ECLSsystems using conventional electromechanical and physiochemical technologies. The WWLSAemploys passive processes using membrane-based technologies, as well as biological processesto increase overall system reliability. For example, photosynthetic bioregenerative systemsusing algae would support carbon dioxide (CO2) removal and oxygen (O2) supply, foodproduction, and waste management. An uncharacterized capability of the algae system is itsuse in environmental thermal control. In this paper, we studied the feasibility of using an algalculture within existing spacecraft cooling loops for controlling or stabilization of thespacecraft cabin thermal environment. This integration would subject the algae to varyingtemperatures and thermal loads. Thus, an experiment was conducted to investigate algalmetabolic response to a cycled thermal environment. Two flasks of cyanobacteria, Spirulina(Athrospira plantensis) were cultured at low light levels (20-40 ¦Ìmol m-2 s-1); one exposed to atemperature cycle of 8¡ã to 31¡ãC over 54 minutes, the other was kept at a sustained 24¡ã - 26¡ãC.The dissolved oxygen content and pH levels were recorded continuously throughout theduration of the experiment. Periodic measurements of cell counts, photosynthetic rates, andrespiration rates were used to assess the overall health of the culture. The thermally cycledculture did not proliferate as much as the control, but it did show a carbon use efficiencywithin the range of the control, indicating a healthy culture. This algal viability duringtemperature cycling is promising for use in thermal technologies, especially for a ¡°warm¡±climate species, such as Spirulina.","Influence of Transient Heat Transfer on Metabolic Functions "

The hope is that these new entities will do something innovative and of far reaching significance in their efforts to control costs. They really cannot afford to send a rover or hopper to the moon, have it travel 500 meters on the surface and transmit data back to Earth as it has been done in the past by the USA, Russia and China. However, it is just as likely that since national space agencies have done something like this, they will just make a weak effort ( probably by companies that were space agency contractors) to master existing technology so as to operate independently but not in a very innovative way. Of the original 16 teams, a critical deadline has now passed that allows one to identify the six serious contenders, essentially the finalists. The other 10 teams that were still in the game did not meet the end of 2015 deadline to book passage to space for their lunar surface vehicle. Examining the support structure of these 6 teams allows one to at the question of whether the fears of pedestrian results with no new corporate players have come to pass or not?","Shadow Boxing: GLXP Team Relationships to Their Respective National Space Agencies "

2598,AIAA-2016-5454,Development Status for a Combined Solid Oxide Co-Electrolyzer and Carbon Formation Reactor System for Oxygen Regeneration,"A critical component in spacecraft life support loop closure is the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2, produced by the crew) from the cabin atmosphere and chemical reduction of this CO2 to recover the oxygen. In 2015, we initiated development of an oxygen recovery system for life support applications consisting of a solid oxide co-electrolyzer (SOCE) and a carbon formation reactor (CFR). The SOCE electrolyzes a combined stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) gas mixtures to produce synthesis gas (e.g., CO and H2 gas) and pure dry oxygen as separate products. This SOCE is being developed from a NASA GRC solid oxide fuel cell and stack design originally developed for aeronautics long-duration power applications. The CFR, being developed by pHMatter LLC, takes the CO and H2 output from the SOCE, and converts it primarily to solid carbon (C(s)) and H2O and CO2. Although the solid carbon accumulates in the CFR, the innovative design allows easy removal of the carbon product, requiring minimal crew member (CM) time and low resupply mass (1.0 kg/year/CM) for replacement of the solid carbon catalyst, a significant improvement over previous Bosch reactor approaches. In this work, we will provide a status of our Phase I efforts in the development and testing of both the SOCE and CFR prototype units, along with an initial assessment of the combined SOCE-CFR system, including a mass and power projections, along with an estimate of the oxygen recovery rate.","Development Status for a Combined Solid Oxide Co-"

The experimental work was carried out by the fabricated designed swirl model in the combustor test rig. The Experimental and computational analysis has been carried out to find out the flow characteristics of the fluid coming out from the swirl component and are used for the flow inside the combustor analysis.

It was also recorded that the recirculation zone length decreases for tested swirl configuration for higher the inlet flow velocities beyond 25 m/s due to the swirl length (5cm) which fails to provide the sufficient recirculating the flow and turbulence level to hold the flame at the combustor.","COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF FLAME "

Swirl type flame holder is widely used in the combustor to hold the flame. The existing swirl model with combustor test rig was used for the present research work of numerical and experimental studies of axial velocity component variation, recirculation zone length, turbulence level with the swirl type flame holder for the afterburner application. The swirl model is drafted with the available dimension of swirl design, the swirl contains four vanes and each vane is 900 apart with swirl angle of 450 by using standard software packages and the meshed model was analyzed by using commercial CFD software. The experimental work was carried out by the fabricated designed swirl model in the combustor test rig. The Experimental and computational analysis has been carried out to find out the flow characteristics of the fluid coming out from the swirl component and are used for the flow inside the combustor analysis.

2620,AIAA-2016-4958,Analytical Modeling of Helium Compressor Performance,"Advanced Generation IV modular reactors, including very high temperature reactors (VHTRs), utilize helium as the working fluid, with a potential for high efficiency power production utilizing helium turbomachinery. Helium is chemically inert and nonradioactive which makes the gas ideal for a nuclear power-plant environment where radioactive leaks are a high concern. These properties of helium gas help to increase the safety features as well as to decrease the aging process of plant components. The lack of sufficient helium turbomachinery data has made it difficult to study the vital role played by the gas turbine components of these VHTR powered cycles. Therefore, this paper focuses on predicting the performance of helium compressors. A FORTRAN 77 program is developed to simulate helium compressor operation, including surge line prediction. The results obtained from the analysis are compared with existing computational and experimental results available in the existing literatures and the data are observed to be in good agreement.","Analytical Modeling of Helium Compressor Performance "
2621,AIAA-2016-4959,Three-objective Optimization for the Design of Mechanical Component Using Evolutionary Numerical Simulation Approach,"The mechanical component design is an iterative, manual and often tedious task, as many real-world engineering design problems involving constraints and complex relationships among several design variables and multiple design objectives. Traditional approaches for solving multiobjective engineering design optimization problems typically scalarize the multiple objectives into a single objective, thus transforming the original multiple objective design problem into a single objective problem with a single solution. However, the known drawbacks of these traditional approaches have motivated researchers and practitioners to seek alternative techniques that yield a set of compromised engineering design solutions called Pareto optimal solutions rather than a single solution. Furthermore, these techniques involve the optimization not only of multiple objectives simultaneously, but also conflicting objectives, where improving one objective degrades the performance of one or more of the other objectives. This research describes a proposed bio-inspired numerical simulation approach that addresses the shortcomings of existing approaches for mechanical design optimization. In this study, we selected to optimize simplified form of cooling channel of a gas turbine blade with turbulators (ribs). The proposed design approach identifies a set of tradeoff design solutions to select from based on design engineer preferences.","Three-objective Optimization for the Design of Mechanical "

In this investigation, a scheme of suction control imposed near the throat of the inlet was carried out to realize the large boundary layer ingestion. The results indicate a slight improvement in the aerodynamic performance of the fan stage after the suc-tion, when it was operated in the prototype condition compared with the uniform air condition. The distorted region at the air intake exit decreases significantly as well. In addition, the low energy fluid gathering at the bottom cross section is decreasing while moving to the tip station of the rotor hub. Resulting in a covering about 3 blade passages at the rotor blade front edge was found in the end. Both the total pressure and velocity of the air in these distorted blade passages are lower but more after the suction than those in other passages. However, serious flow separations occur at the stator blade suction side in the influence of the large boundary ingestion in the prototype condition. And they mainly happen at the 50% span and weaken with the suction.","Numerical investigation on influence of suction in S-shaped "

The liner wall temperature distribution along axial and circumferential direction was obtained, which indicate that FAR is the vital influence factor on wall temperature, the increase of burner inlet temperature lead to slightly increase of wall temperature. The highest wall temperature rise is 116K which achieved at 0.037 FAR.

The xenon ion velocity distribution function was measured simultaneouslyalong the axial and radial directions. An ultimate exhaust velocity of 19.6 0.25 km/s achieved ata distance of 20 mm was measured, and that value was not sensitive to pressure. On the otherhand, the ion axial velocity at the thruster exit was strongly influenced by pressure, indicatingthat the accelerating electric field moved inward with increased pressure. The shift in electricfield corresponded to an increase in measured thrust. Pressure had a minor effect on the radialcomponent of ion velocity, mainly affecting ions exiting close to the channel inner wall. At thatradial location the radial component of ion velocity was approximately 1000 m/s greater at thelowest pressure than at the highest pressure. A reduction of the inner magnet coil current by 0.6 Aresulted in a lower axial ion velocity at the channel exit while the radial component of ion velocityat the channel inner wall location increased by 1300 m/s, and at the channel outer wall locationthe radial ion velocity remained unaffected. The ultimate exhaust velocity was not significantlyaffected by the inner magnet current.","52nd AIAA/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, AIAA Propulsion and Energy Forum and Exposition, Salt Lake City, 2016"

2628,AIAA-2016-4854,A Comparative Evaluation of Heat Transfer and Friction Behavior of a Square Channel with Sharp and Rounded 45Â° Ribs at Wide Range of Reynolds Numbers Using Experimental and Numerical Computation,"An investigation of heat transfer and friction behavior for a fully developed flow in a square channel roughened with 45¡ã ribs was conducted over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Re) from 6,000 to 180,000. Two types of ribs were investigated, namely a) sharp edge and b) rounded edge ribs. The ratio of rib height to channel hydraulic diameter (e/Dh) and the ratio of pitch to rib height (p/e) were 0.063 and 10, respectively. The round ribs have fillet on all edges and the fillet radius was set to half of the rib height (e/2). Experimental data are validated by comparing the results of the sharp edge ribs with data available in existing literature in Re ranging from 6,000 to 70,000. An extensive investigation was performed at higher Re up to 180,000 for both types of ribs. In both cases, flow becomes fully developed after 8Dh for all the Re values. The results show that rounding the ribs¡¯ edges causes lower heat transfer than the sharp edge ribs for all the Re. The rounded edge ribs cause less and less heat transfer than the sharp edge ribs with increasing Re (e.g., at Re¡Ö180,000, rounded ribs causes~17% lower heat transfer). On the contrary, the rounded edge ribs result in only 4%-5% lower friction than the sharp ribs. In addition to the experimental studies, numerical studies were also conducted by solving steady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations. These numerical simulations were performed by applying a periodic fully developed flow condition. Three different turbulence models, namely realizable k¨C¦Å, v2-f, and SST k-¦Ø were used to solve the RANS equations. The results of each turbulence model are compared with the experimental data to shed light on the prediction capability of these models. It is found that SST k-¦Ø shows excellent agreement for the heat transfer results for both cases. However, these three turbulence models do not predict the friction factor very reliably.","A Comparative Evaluation of Heat Transfer and Friction "

Time-dependentlaser-induced  uorescence is used to measure the ion velocity distribution functions (IVDFs)with a modulating anode voltage. [Diallo et al. RSI 2015] Experimental results suggestthat the IVDFs vanish or shifts its peak to a small velocity near the maximum peak ofthe discharge current oscillation. A zero-dimensional plasma global model [Hara et al.PoP 2014] is used to analyze the ionization oscillation mode by forcing the electric  eld tooscillate with a certain strength and frequency. In this model, the neutral atom continuityequation, the ion continuity and momentum equations, and electron energy equation aretaken into account. Global model suggests that the ion mean velocity can  uctuate in timeand is in-phase with the electric  eld oscillation. A 1D hybrid simulation shows that therecan be a region where ion distribution exists in slow velocity ( 1000 m/s) due to reversedelectric  eld during the oscillation.","Measurements and theory of driven breathing oscillations"

Two sleeve angles of 15 degree and 35 degree are studied on the LBO performance of the TeLESS-II combustor. The experimental LBO performance of the 35o sleeve case under room temperature and pressure is better than that of the 15o sleeve case. CFD simulations of cold flow field and reaction flow field are carried out to better understand the test results. The simulated cold flow fields of the two cases are very similar. The simulated reaction field indicates that the different LBO performance may be caused by the different heat release characteristics.

2633,AIAA-2016-4867,Effects of Radiation Heating on Additively Printed Hybrid Fuel Grain O/F Shift,"Utah State University has developed a hybrid rocket system that uses a common industrial plastic ABS as the fuel material. The rocket grains are fabricated using a type of 3-D printing known as Fused Deposition Modeling. Although ABS has been demonstrated as an effective rocket fuel, the material possesses unique burn characteristics that have not been previously observed with most hybrid fuels including HTPB, the most commonly used hybrid fuel. HTPB fuel regression rates are observed to be strongly dependent on the oxidizer mass flux rate, and only weakly depend on motor size. By contrast, ABS regression rates show very strong size dependence. Whereas HTPB fuel grains tend towards a lean O/F ratio as burn time progresses, ABS fuel grains tend to become fuel rich. Regression rate data was collected from a series of burn tests on 98, 76, 54, and 38mm diameter motors. When the regression rate and oxidizer mass flux data are fit with an exponential curve, a very strong correlation to motor diameter is observed. A model is developed to support the hypothesis that the correlation of the burn exponent with the motor scale actually results from neglected radiant heating terms that are strongly correlated with motor diameter.","Effects of Radiation Heating on Additively Printed Hybrid Fuel Grain O/F Shift "

2639,AIAA-2016-4784,Effect of Radiation on Gas Turbine Combustor Liner Temperature with Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) Methodology,"Design of a gas turbine combustor is a challenging process. It contains many stages including estimation of liner wall temperatures in order to determine the lifetime of the engine. Therefore, accurate prediction of the liner wall temperature is an essential part of the gas turbine combustor design. The liner is heated by convection and radiation of the combustion gases inside the flame tube and it is cooled by convection to the air in annulus and radiation to the outer casing. Many studies have been performed with Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) methodology neglecting the effect of radiation on the liner temperature due to its complexity and limited computational power sources. The Effect of radiative heat transfer on combustor liner temperature using CHT methodology is studied in the present work. Radiation from luminous flame which is caused by formation of soot particles in the flame is not accounted for and radiation from non-luminous flame due to combustion gases, CO2 and H2O, and surface radiation is investigated.

Flame temperature was estimated using a blackbody emission fit. The addition of stearic acid to the fuel increased fuel grain strength but was not detectable in emission spectra.

2645,AIAA-2016-4966,a Spinning Wave Generator and Modulated Fuel/Oxidizer Mixing,"A Continuous Rotating Detonation Engine (CRDE) was tested with two unique features.First, the conventional pre-detonator was replaced by a novel detonation wave generator. Thisgenerator sequentially fired spark plugs at a speed near the acoustic speed of a reactant gasmixture thereby producing free radicals ready to partake in detonation. The generatorinitiated high speed detonation waves traveling with set direction in gaseous mixtures of H2and O2. Detonation waves continued to spin in a self-sustained fashion after turning off thewave generator. The number of simultaneous sparks did not influence the number ofdetonation waves observed. Instead the number of observed detonation waves was a strongfunction of the mass flow rate of reactants. Second, the fuel and oxidizer were injected radially.To avoid the thrust-area loss of conventional axial injection, all injection holes were orientedalong the annulus radially, thereby allowing the high pressure to work over the entire frontendwall of the combustor. Furthermore, radial injection modulated the mixing of fuel andoxidizer to adjust the axial location of detonation zones to avoid erosion of the coaxialelectrodespark plugs.","Design and Experiments of a Continuous Rotating Detonation Engine: "

Then, amechanism of the wave generator to initiate detonation is presented. It is based on theinteraction among the free-radicals produced by sparking, their chain propagation, andtransition into detonation waves. Besides the wave generator, the model is applicable to selfsustaineddetonation waves, and serves to explain the formation of fresh reactants triangleand the deflagration along its hypotenuse. Furthermore, the model points out thegeometrical similarity between the fresh reactants triangle and the velocity triangle; relatingthe mass flow rate to the wave passing frequency and the longitudinal size of the detonationwaves.

2656,AIAA-2016-4896,Multi-Fidelity Framework for Modeling Combustion Instability,A multi-fidelity framework for combustion instability modeling is established by integrating a reduced-order model (ROM) for combustion response into the linearized Euler equations. The ROM is developed from CFD simulations of periodic forcing on a reduced domain using Galerkin¡¯s method to reduce the high-order PDEs to a lower-order ODE system via POD eigen-bases generated from the reduced-domain dataset. Evaluations of the framework are performed based on simplified test problems for a model rocket combustor showing distinguishable instability behaviors. The coupling between the ROM and the Euler equations requires two-way information transfer between the two systems. Results show that the fraction of the complete domain represented by the ROM can be chosen to simplify the interaction between the two levels of solution. The multi-fidelity model is capable of capturing the overall instability trends although some discrepancies due to unstable generic responses arising from the reduced-domain simulations.,"Multi-Fidelity Framework for Modeling Combustion "

Above a pressure threshold, the propellant does not extinguish but sustains combustion even without electrical inputs. Among solid propellants, ESP¡¯s have the advantage of supporting multiple start/stop and throttling events. Numerous mechanisms have been considered to explain the observed electrical response at lower pressures. The present study postulates a basic electrolytic theory for combustion in a baseline ESP formulation consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN). The theory suggests possible oxidation/reduction equations for combustion at the anode as well as the cathode. It also provides an explanation why combustion is observed preferentially at the anode only under certain boundary conditions. An equation is included for the overall combustion process which accounts for the assumed combustion products.","Approved for Public Release 16-MDA-8761 (18 June 16) "

Thisleads to an orbit propagation error of 200 km observed in the initial flight data of VELOX-PII picosatellite¡¯sattitude determination and control system (ADCS). This error can be corrected by using a pre-processedmethod. In our new VELOX-II nanosatellite mission, both the primary and secondary payloads require apointing accuracy better than 5 degrees. High orbit propagation error results in a higher attitudedetermination error. To improve the orbit propagation accuracy without either occupying additionalmicrocontroller memory or physical space in the VELOX-II, a pre-process two-line element method wasproposed. Initial theoretical study has shown that the orbit propagation accuracy of 20 km error and targetpointing knowledge error less than 1 degree can be achieved. In this paper, the in-orbit data of VELOX-II iscompared with real-time GPS data and ground propagated data to verify the accuracy of the proposed preprocessedTLE method.

Typi-cally, the spacecraft is assumed to be a point-mass, and this simpli ed model neglects thecoupling between orbital and rotational motions of a rigid body. Additionally, in recentworks that consider the spacecraft as a rigid body, a second degree-and-order sphericalharmonics gravitational  eld has been used for the asteroid. This model does not accu-rately reect the complex gravitational  eld of most small bodies, and does not convergeinside the Brillouin sphere. This paper proposes an high  delity gravitational model, thataccounts for the orbital-attitude coupling e ect for a rigid body spacecraft, while reect-ing more accurately the irregular gravitational  eld of asteroids. This proposed model isbased on the polyhedron gravitational model, augmented with point-masses distributed inthe interior of the small body shape model. Simulations for the orbital motion of a rigidbody spacecraft are presented, where the proposed gravitational model is compared to thespherical harmonics gravitational model expanded up to second degree-and-order. A com-parison between point-mass and rigid body spacecraft orbital trajectories is also shown.These simulations are performed for trajectories in close proximity to asteroids 433 Erosand 4769 Castalia, including the gravitational e ects of the Sun.","Modeling Spacecraft Orbit-Attitude Coupled"

Giventhe recent focus on reusable launch vehicles, the UMd study team decided to investigate expendable/reusabletrades throughout the lunar exploration architecture. The study began with an updated definition of a ¡°baseline¡±modular architecture for human lunar exploration, based on the use of a Falcon Heavy launch vehiclewith a Delta Common Second Stage for Earth departure. This configuration provides a payload of 23.6 MTto lunar transfer orbit. The reference architecture involves the use of multiple orbital propulsion modules fororbital maneuvers, a dedicated lunar landing module for lunar touchdown, and a 7 MT-class crew modulewhich is used throughout the mission, including launch, lunar surface, and Earth entry, descent, and landing.All propulsion elements are restricted to storable hypergolic propellants, and all non-essential technology suchas orbital propellant depots and vehicle-vehicle propellant transfers, are ruled out of the baseline architecture.Economic analysis shows that the baseline can support human lunar exploration missions for less that $2Bwith a mission model of 5 lunar missions, and with larger program commitments can provide human lunarexploration missions in the vicinity of $1B/mission. Individual elements of the baseline architecture were thenmodified to accommodate reuse, and the economic analysis updated to investigate cost feasibility.","The Effect of Reusability in"

2679,AIAA-2016-5760,On-Board Low Resolution Digital Predistortion for SATCOM,"Non-linear high power amplifiers (HPAs) are an integral part of the transmission chain for satellite transponders.Due to the power, weight and cost limitations, the HPAs present in the satellite transponders are operatedin the so called multi-carrier mode, i.e. multiple carriers access a single satellite transponder. Thoughthe multi-carreir mode allows better utilization of satellite¡¯s resources, but it also leads to severe non-linearinter channel/carrier interferences (ICI) especially when the HPAs are driven close to the saturation point. Asolution to compensate for such non-linearities is to perform signal predistortion. With the emergence of onboardprocessors (OBPs), we can perform digital adaptive signal predistortion on the satellite transponders toremove non-linear effects of the HPA and improve the system performance. But the presence of OBPs leads tohigher design complexity, power consumption and equipment costs, all of which translate to more expensivesatellite transponders. One way to reduce all these costs is to use lower resolution processors, analog to digitalconverters (ADCs) and digital to analog converters (DACs) on-board for implementing digital predistortion.Therefore, in this paper we try to find out whether low resolution digital predistorters can achieve good performance,and if so, how low the resolution for the OBPs, ADCs and DACs can be before the quantization effectsstrongly deteriorate the system performance. To this end we implement a low-effort Kth order memorylesspolynomial predistorter to compensate for the HPA¡¯s non-linearities and analyze the effects of lowering theresolution for ADCs, DACs and OBPs on the bit error rate (BER) performance when digital predistortion isperformed.","On-Board Low Resolution Digital Predistortion for SATCOM"

At the receiver (Rx) side, the divided sub-spectra are combined and the single carrier modulated signal is regenerated. We build a DSDT adapter and subject it to Ku-band satellite experiments. The results show that the BER performance of the spectrum divided signals approaches that of the non-divided case regardless of spectrum division.

Although our previous reports indicate high thermal efficiencies at some Machnumber conditions around sound speed, there were very less investigations at very lowpiston speed below 2,000rpm and at the hypersonic regime. Present computational resultsshow that we can get higher thermal efficiency over 50% even in low piston speeds (about1,000 rpm) by using the piston movement of a sigmoid manner.

For this study, a parametricmodel for the propulsion system has been implemented taking into account the detrimentalperformance e ects due to BLI and intake pressure losses. To assess the suitability of thesetechnologies, the power consumption and boundary layer characteristics at propulsor's in-take have been studied. The study case is de ned for the Andean region which is 3000 mabove sea level. Preliminary results show that BLI does not present representative bene- ts compared with its installation complexities.

The attenuation field is obtained by firstcombining three-dimensional rain rate and cloud fields so as tomaintain their spatial correlation, and afterwards by simulating theinteraction of the wireless system with the complete atmosphericenvironment. This approach allows a ¡°real-time¡± combination of theattenuation induced by precipitation and clouds (in contrast to thesummation of such contributions on statistical basis as currentlyrecommended by ITU-R) which increases the model¡¯s predictionaccuracy and reliability.

The 55-75W input propulsion system utilizes a 2.5cm-grid-diameter RF ion thruster ¡°BIT-3¡± and a micro RF cathode ¡°BRFC-1¡± as the neutralizer. Prototypes of both devices have demonstrated operation with iodine propellant. The BIT-3 thruster has been matured to the Engineering Model level, with measured thrust ranging from 0.65 to 1.15mN. The specific impulse, when taking into account the RF neutralizer¡¯s propellant consumption, varies between 1200 and 2100sec. The performance results were verified with xenon propellant using a torsional thrust stand that is highly accurate. The thrust data are shown in good agreement with values predicted by the electrostatic thrust equation. Thrust measurement with iodine propellant is ongoing, but earlier results show that iodine will produce at least as much thrust as xenon, if not more, suggesting significant I2+ ion presence in the beam. The advances in the BIT-3 thruster and the BRFC-1 neutralizer technologies are being complemented by major breakthroughs in flight electronics development, including miniaturized packaging with selected radiation-tolerant components and >90% proven efficiency for the RF power supplies.","Maturation of Iodine-Fueled BIT-3 RF Ion Thruster and "

However, the guard-ring erosion rate in anode layer thrusters is not negligibly small so far, and further erosion reduction is expected by modifying the magnetic circuit. In this research, two different field designs, strong MS and weak MS, and conductive/nonconductive guard-ring materials were tested. The strong MS design showed low oscillation amplitude at same magnetic flux density, but high efficiency operation was limited in a narrow band of flux density. With BN coated guard-rings, thruster operation was very unstable, and considerable ions were found accelerated toward the guard-ring.","Operational Properties of UT-58 Anode Layer Hall Thruster "

A fully kinetic two dimensional particle-in-cell simulation method with Monte Carlo collision approach (PIC/MCC) is used to model the discharge of a Hall thruster. Microscopic research of a single electron trajectory can characterize the particle behavior in the Hall thruster. It is demonstrated that the electrons¡¯ trajectories are affected by the magnetic field, collisions with neutrals and ions, and the electron kinetic energy. In simulation of the electron transport process, both classical and anomalous diffusion are discussed. It is theoretically derived that when B is larger than mve/e, the importance of the Bohm diffusion rises with a further increase of B. It is suggested that a model with anomalous diffusion better fits the experimental results. To accelerate ions more efficiently and achieve better performance for this TAL model, the zone of potential drop should be moved downstream the thruster.","Influence of Multiple Factors on Electron Behavior and "

JAXA fully kinetic particle code was applied to the discharge simulation of a SPT-100-like Hall thruster (discharge voltage 300 V and mass flow rate 5 mg/s operation condition), and four different cases of cathode boundary treatment were tested. Agreement of thrust and discharge current within 10 % error compared to the measurement were achieved without using any anomalous diffusion models in the baseline case treating the cathode boundary empirically. The preliminary simulation results of the cases treating the cathode boundary suggested that the electron injection conditions (quasi-neutrality, energy, density) can have significant impact on the simulation result of the plasma properties and electron flow.","The Effects of Cathode Boundary Condition on Particle "

2703,AIAA-2016-4869,Pressure Oscillation and Combustion in Shear Layer of Hybrid Rocket Post Chamber,"In recent experiments, CH* luminosity fluctuations with a frequency of 500 Hz were observed both in stable and unstable combustions. This study focused on the investigation of the coupling mechanism of the shear flow combustion with the LFI occurrence in hybrid rocket combustion. CH* luminosity fluctuates at a frequency about 500 Hz both in stable combustion and in LFI condition. Also, the luminosity images confirm that the combustion occurs along the shear flow and the luminosity varies at about 500 Hz even though the variation is very weak. In unstable combustions, the coherence was increased to near 1. Also, the phase difference between two 500 Hz fluctuations was decreased less than ¦Ð/2 showing a positive coupling. And CH* luminosity images shows a periodic appearance of the partial flame extinction in the steady axisymmetric vortex structure due to the combustion along the shear flow. In a section prior to LFI occurrence, Transition region was confirmed by comparing coherence and phase difference between pressure and luminosity oscillations. Interestingly, the positive coupling and strong coherence at about 500 Hz followed by increase of coherence at about 20 Hz were observed. From these results, the positive coupling between pressure and CH* luminosity in frequency at about 500 Hz is regarded as a precursor to the CH* luminosity at about 20 Hz, which leads to LFI occurrence.","Dynamics of Post Chamber Flame and Combustion Pressure "

Using a similarapproach, a self-similar solution is derived from the axisymmetric streamfunction-vorticity relation underthe auspices of steady, rotational, inviscid, and incompressible fluid motion. Starting with the Bragg-Hawthorne equation in cylindrical coordinates and using a judicious choice of boundary conditions, closedformexpressions are obtained for the streamfunction, velocity, vorticity, and pressure distributions as well asthe basic characteristics of the flowfield, including the fundamental eigenvalue, maximum velocities, mantlepositioning, and spatial shifting of the velocity and vorticity peaks with successive increases in the inner coreradius. The latter is modelled as a dimensionless fraction of the chamber diameter that is impermeableto the annular flow. By way of comparison, our results are showcased for di erent swirl numbers, aspectratios, and inner core fractions. They are also compared to their counterparts arising in the context of ahelical flow analog of the complex-lamellar type (Barber, T. A., Cecil, O.

A 3-step finite rate kinetics model is modified to be more consistent with the detailed kinetics for robust cavity burning at high temperatures. Simulations using the new 3-step mechanism and a larger 22-species mechanism are conducted and compared using a steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation. Results suggest the modified 3-step mechanism is appropriate for use in the unsteady simulation. Both steady and unsteady computations predict the effect of heat release on the velocity field and fuel concentrations consistent with the experiment. The unsteady simulation over-predicts the fuel concentration in the upstream portion of the cavity. Analysis of resolved and modeled turbulent kinetic energy in the unsteady and steady simulations suggest a turbulent kinetic energy mismatch that is more significant in the reacting simulations due to the effect of heat release on resolved turbulence. In the unsteady simulation, under-prediction of turbulent diffusion in the shear layer reduces fuel transport out of the cavity leading to a cavity that is more fuel-rich than the experiment.","Reacting Hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes/Large-"

The simplifications leading to the flamelet models come with a few,but potentially significant, limitations. The one we address in this work pertains to thepressure field in the real flow, vis-?vis, the pressure field used in generating the look-uptable. Because of the disconnect between these two fields, we seek to determine the requiredmodifications of the canonical solutions.

In this paper, the entrance of combustor Mach number is 2.5, while theranges of total pressure and stagnation temperature varied are 1.59 MPa and 1815 K,respectively. Based on a series of governing equations included the effects of area change andthe static pressure data along the bottom wall of the combustor obtained from a supersoniccombustion ramjet engine experiment, an iterative procedure is implemented to calculate avarious of parameters such as Mach number, total temperature, total pressure, statictemperature and so on.

2709,AIAA-2016-4761,Detached Eddy Simulation of a high-Ma regenerative-cooled scramjet combustor based on skeletal kerosene mechanism,"Experimental data, whether ground or flight based, for hypersonic air-breathing combustors are difficult and expensive to be measured, thus high-fidelity modeling is not only supplementary but necessary to gain an in-depth understanding of the internal flow, mixing and combustion processes inside the combustors. A high-fidelity modeling requires the physical models, the combustion chemistry, the thermodynamical properties, and the boundary conditions to be simulated as accurately as possible. In this study, Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) is applied to model a full-scale scramjet combustor, which has an active-cooling system embedded inside the wall. The fuel is China Daqing RP-3 aviation kerosene, whose combustion chemistry is described by an updated skeletal mechanism consisting of 28 species and 92 elementary reactions. The current mechanism exhibits a better agreement in ignition delay than the previous 39-species mechanism. The mechanism reduction is conducted by using directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA) method. A series of experimental tests corresponding to different flight Mach numbers are conducted in the long-time direct connect supersonic combustion test platform (abbreviated as DTZ) installed in Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The current modeled cases and previous modeled cases correspond to the regimes of flight Ma (Mach number)¡Ý6 and Ma<6 respectively. Cases at fuel-lean and unity global fuel equivalence ratios are modeled for comparison. The time-averaged static pressure and wall heat flux are well captured in comparison with the experimental data. The mean and instantaneous flow fields are then analyzed by the aid of several quantative indices, such as Takeno Flame Index, Dmkohler number, PaSR coefficient and scalar dissipation rate. The combined flow, mixing and reaction processes are revealed. The combustor runs in scramjet mode with the supersonic core flow shrinks as the global fuel equivalence ratio increases, and the flame stabilizes in cavity mode. The chemical time scale is generally larger than the diffusion time scale, which is then much larger than the convection time scale, implying that the reactants are transported or dispersed elsewhere before they are completely reacted.","Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation of a high-Ma "

A comparison of measured and predicted plume shocklocations has also been conducted to augment the signature study. Overall, the analysis ofthe trial data suggests that the plume is representative of an oxidizer/fuel ratio lower thanthe nominal measured value. There is evidence to suggest that unburnt oxidizer may beentering the plume, as a result of incomplete propellant mixing, and hence rendering thecombustion process in the engine chamber more fuel-rich than intended.","Characterizing the Infrared Signature of a Liquid "

In as-trodynamics, space situational awareness (SSA) is a major area that relies on uncertaintyquanti cation to estimate a space object's state and its associated uncertainty. This datais invaluable for making informed decisions regarding probability of collision, tracking, andcatalog maintenance. A new method for uncertainty quanti cation based on orthogonalpolynomials and the application of Liouville's theorem is developed.

2719,AIAA-2016-5656,Covariance Manipulation for Conjunction Assessment,"The manipulation of space object covariances to try to provide additional or improved information to conjunction risk assessment is not an uncommon practice. Types of manipulation include fabricating a covariance when it is missing or unreliable to force the probability of collision (Pc) to a maximum value (¡°PcMax¡±), scaling a covariance to try to improve its realism or see the effect of covariance volatility on the calculated Pc, and constructing the equivalent of an epoch covariance at a convenient future point in the event (¡°covariance forecasting¡±). In bringing these methods to bear for Conjunction Assessment (CA) operations, however, some do not remain fully consistent with best practices for conducting risk management, some seem to be of relatively low utility, and some require additional information before they can contribute fully to risk analysis. This study describes some basic principles of modern risk management (following the Kaplan construct) and then examines the PcMax and covariance forecasting paradigms for alignment with these principles; it then further examines the expected utility of these methods in the modern CA framework. Both paradigms are found to be not without utility, but only in situations that are somewhat carefully circumscribed.","Covariance Manipulation for Conjunction Assessment "

2722,AIAA-2016-5669,Multi-Objective Optimal Control of the Ascent Trajectories of Launch Vehicles,"This paper presents a novel approach to the solution of multi-objective optimal controlproblems. The proposed solution strategy is based on the integration of the Direct FiniteElements Transcription method, to transcribe dynamics and objectives, with a memeticstrategy called Multi Agent Collaborative Search (MACS). The original multi-objectiveoptimal control problem is reformulated as a bi-level nonlinear programming problem. Inthe outer level, handled by MACS, trial control vectors are generated and passed to theinner level, which enforces the solution feasibility. Solutions are then returned to the outerlevel to evaluate the feasibility of the corresponding objective functions, adding a penaltyvalue in the case of infeasibility. An optional single level re nement is added to improvethe ability of the scheme to converge to the Pareto front. The capabilities of the proposedapproach will be demonstrated on the multi-objective optimisation of ascent trajectoriesof launch vehicles.","Multi-Objective Optimal Control of Ascent"

2733,AIAA-2016-5300,"SONATE - A Nano Satellite for the In-Orbit Verification of Autonomous Detection, Planning and Diagnosis Technologies","Classical satellite operations are heavily dependent on support of an expert team on ground. Almost all activities are planned by mission control, transmitted to the satellite as time tagged tele commands and executed on board based on the schedule. In the case of transient and unpredictable events like a meteor, which we want to detect and monitor from space or in the case of an on board anomaly, this classical approach is not suitable or even impossible to apply. In both cases it might be too late to react on ground if the event is not predictable and/or transient. A meteor entering Earth¡¯s atmosphere can for instance typically not be planned since the time and place of the event is typically not known until it occurs.

A crucial aspect of this high fidelity is modeling the components susceptible to flexingand vibration. For most spacecraft, the flexible components are appended objects like solar panels andthe vibrational component is fuel slosh. However, to incorporate these effects into numerical simulation,extensive derivation is required because the single rigid-body assumption no longer applies. There issignificant on-going research on how to effectively model structural flexing and slosh dynamics usingmulti-body dynamics. However, many formulations require complex re-derivations for a specific spacecraftdesign. This paper introduces a ready-to-be-applied solution to rigorously integrate structuralflexing and fuel slosh dynamics into a numerical simulation using the classical Newtonian and Eulerianapproach. This solution can be applied to a wide variety of spacecraft configurations. This formulationapproximates solar panel flexing with hinged rigid body dynamics and fuel slosh with a lumped mass vibrationalmodel. A novel contribution of this paper is a generalized back-substitution method which canincrease the computational efficiency (as much as a 180% speedup).

One of the most important aspects to consider when entering such an environment is the information that needs to be conveyed to the human operator for their safety and for the control of the vehicle that allows them to experience that environment. Primarily, this information is conveyed visually through one or more displays. Different visual and vestibular disturbances are induced by microgravity. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a terrestrial test method for the design, demonstration of method, and testing of displays for microgravity.

To aid in these objectives, the Robotic In-situ Surface Exploration System (RISES) was developed through the NASA Early Stage Innovations program. The concept of RISES was to integrate non-destructive testing methods with robotic systems for specimen property determination. The Schmidt Hammer (SH) and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) methods were chosen for evaluation based on feasibility, simplicity, and applicability to space conditions. The latest SH based prototype designed for robotic integration was titled the Impact Sensor-2 (IS-2). The IS-2 incorporates a simplified SH tool and is mounted to the force torque sensor (FTS) located at the distal end of a 7 degree of freedom robotic manipulator, which corresponds to the robotic configuration planned for ARM. While a traditional SH is based solely on an analog rebound value, analysis was conducted to determine if similar information could be obtained through use of the time history of the force readings provided by the FTS. Initial tests of the IS-2 were performed on asteroid analogous rock core samples, isotropic samples, and fibrous samples. Material and strength differentiation has been observed through various metrics extracted from the collected force readings.

Current and proposed launch vehicles are incapable of launching all of the requisite mass on a single vehicle; hence, multiple launches and in-space aggregation are required to perform a Mars mission. This study examines the potential of reusable chemical propulsion stages based in cis-lunar space to meet the transportation objectives of the Evolvable Mars Campaign and identifies cis-lunar propellant supply requirements. These stages could be supplied with fuel and oxidizer delivered to cis-lunar space, either launched from Earth or other inner solar system sources such as the Moon or near Earth asteroids. The effects of uncertainty in the model parameters are evaluated through sensitivity analysis of key parameters including the liquid propellant combination, inert mass fraction of the vehicle, change in velocity margin, and change in payload masses. The outcomes of this research include a description of the transportation elements, the architecture that they enable, and an option for a campaign that meets the objectives of the Evolvable Mars Campaign. This provides a more complete understanding of the propellant requirements, as a function of time, that must be delivered to cis-lunar space. Over the selected sensitivity ranges for the current payload and schedule requirements of the 2016 point of departure of the Evolvable Mars Campaign destination systems, the resulting propellant delivery quantities are between 34 and 61 tonnes per year of hydrogen and oxygen propellant, or between 53 and 76 tonnes per year of methane and oxygen propellant, or between 74 and 92 tonnes per year of hypergolic propellant.","Cis-Lunar Reusable In-Space Transportation Architecture "
2749,AIAA-2016-4808,Reconfigurable Distributed Control Systems for Turbine Engine Operation Uncertainties,"Gain scheduling is a common practice technique used by conventional control systems when the controlled plant is subject to dynamic changes in its operation. In this strategy, gains of the controllers are varied in accordance with some exogenous parameters. A strategy that has been commonly practiced in the control of aircrafts and their propulsion systems. Where parameters of the operation environment, e.g., altitude, pressure, ambient temperature, power demand etc., are expected to significantly change. Such changes require comparable changes in the control actions to achieve a particular performance. Traditionally, the adjustment to the controller gains are made in a step-wise, resulting in bumpy control action due to transient effect at the time of a gain adjustment. To avoid these transient effects or sudden changes in the engine performance, the gain scheduling must produce infinitely small changes in the control action. This can be achieved by developing nonlinear continuous-time function to relate changes in the exogenous variables to the controller gains. Hence, we present development and implementation of control reconfiguration approach to continuously adjust the controller gains of turbine engine using artificial intelligence technique. In this paper, an artificial intelligent technique has been investigated and used in the development of advanced adaptation and reconfiguration control algorithm for turbine engine distributed control system. Specifically, the second Tagaki-Sugeno fuzzy approach is used to continuously schedule the gains of a distributed control system as combination of a weighted sum of several distributed controllers designed at different operation points of the engine. Adding adaptation and reconfiguration feature to the distributed control system of turbine engines has improved engine performance and provided more efficient and smooth engine transient operation under wide range of uncertainties. Developmental steps, implementation architecture and simulation test results of the proposed fuzzy gain scheduling of distributed control system are reported in this paper.","Reconfigurable Distributed Control System for "

2754,AIAA-2016-4810,(The Apollo 11 Plus 50 Project),"The Revolutionary Innovative Turbine Engine£¨RITE£©is a novel concept turbine engine, which integrates the technology of dual compression rotor (DCR) and inter turbine burner (ITB). What¡¯s more, the RITE concept represents a paradigm shift from traditional turbofan design and offers the potential to improve current standards for turbofan cores. By studying the conventional turbofan base engine and RITE core turbofan, the simulation models were built. Then, analysis on different thermodynamic cycle parameters and performance comparisons between turbofan base engine and RITE core turbofan were conducted. In particular, the matching of FFC, CC and RFC pressure ratio as well as MB and ITB exit temperature of RITE core turbofan were performed. The results indicates that, comparing with conventional turbofan base engine, RITE core turbofan gains better performance improvement at high speed and high compressor pressure ratio, which provides a design basis for high-performance engines. Besides, the performance of RITE core turbofan is improved as reversed flow compressor (RFC) pressure ratio increases, while with the increasing of forward flow compressor (FFC) and centrifugal compressor (CC) pressure ratio, both specific thrust (ST) and specific fuel consumption (SFC) are nearly decreasing. In addition, ST is more sensitive to the change of FFC pressure ratio while SFC is more sensitive to the change of RFC pressure ratio. And the interaction of FFC and CC is much more intense than that of CC and RFC. Unlike the turbofan base engine, the performance of RITE core turbofan is improved as main burner (MB) exit temperature increases while SFC continues to increasing as ITB exit temperature increases. However, the performance of RITE core turbofan, especially the ST, is mainly determined by ITB exit temperature. In general, particularly attention is the unique characters of special components of RITE, namely DCR and ITB.","Parametric Cycle Analysis of a Turbofan with Core Engine "

These studies have indicated that if the aerodynamic ande ciency losses were minimised, the propulsion system demonstrated substantial powerconsumption bene ts in comparison to equivalent propulsion systems operating in free-stream ow. Previously assessed analytical methods for BLI simulation have been froman uninstalled perspective. This research will present the formulation of an rapid ana-lytical method for preliminary design studies which evaluates the installed performanceof a boundary layer ingesting system. The method uses boundary layer theory and onedimensional gas dynamics to assess the performance of an integrated system.The method was applied to a case study of the distributed propulsor array of ablended wing body aircraft. There was particular focus on assessment how local owcharacteristics inuence the performance of individual propulsors and the propulsionsystem as a whole. The application of the model show that the spanwise ow variationhas a signi cant impact on the performance of the array as a whole. A clear optimumdesign point is identi ed which minimises the power consumption for an array with a xed con guration and net propulsive force requirement. In addition, the sensitivity ofthe system to distortion related losses is determined and a point is identi ed where aconventional free-stream propulsor is the lower power option.

NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) completed the assembly of the ASRG EU2 in September, 2014 using hardware from the now cancelled ASRG flight development project. The ASRG EU2 integrated the first pair of Sunpower¡¯s ASC-E3 Stirling convertors (ASC-E3 #1 and #2) in an aluminum generator housing with Lockheed Martin¡¯s Engineering Development Unit (EDU) 4 controller. After just 179 hours of EU2 generator operation, the first power fluctuation occurred on ASC-E3 #1. The first power fluctuation occurred 175 hours later on ASC-E3 #2. Over time, the power fluctuations became more frequent on both convertors and larger in magnitude. Eventually the EU2 was shut down in January, 2015. An anomaly investigation was chartered to determine root cause of the power fluctuations and other anomalous observations. A team with members from GRC, Sunpower, and Lockheed Martin conducted a thorough investigation of the EU2 anomalies. Findings from the EU2 disassembly identified proximate causes of the anomalous observations. Discussion of the team¡¯s assessment of the primary possible failure theories, root cause, and conclusions is provided.

Static performance tests and bind-up tests of eight different non-contacting finger seal configurations were conducted in air at pressure differentials up to 689.4 kPa and temperatures up to 922 K. Four of the seals tested were designed to have lift pads concentric to a herringbone-grooved rotor which generates hydrodynamic lift when rotating. The remaining seals were tested with a smooth rotor; one seal had a circumferential taper and one had an axial taper on the lift pad inner diameter to create hydrodynamic lift during rotation. The effects of the aft finger axial thickness and of the forward finger inner diameter on leakage performance were investigated as well and compared to analytical predictions.,"Non-Contacting Finger Seals Static Performance Test "

Heat exchangers and hotsurfaces were examined. TEG materials introduce thermal resistance which complicatesintegration. Heat exchangers must increase in size in order to meet heat transferrequirements and consequently trade unfavorably due to increased fuel burn. Hot surfacessuch as the engine cases show promise for targeted applications. Blanketing engine caseswith TEG devices impedes the heat flux which risks the formation of hot spots, however,localized power generation on a small scale exhibits promise.

In this work the ion velocity distribution has been measured using laser-inducedfluorescence (LIF) at several high-current operating conditions on the centerline of a 100A class hollow cathode. The wave energy associated with IAT was also measured andshown to correlate with the ion temperature deduced from the LIF measurements. Bothparameters are found to increase with distance downstream of the cathode keeper face. Aparametric study of the ion heating as a function of discharge current and cathode flowrate was also performed. It was found that both increasing current and decreasing flowrate increased the amount of ion heating but the change in heating was more sensitive toflow rate.

2764,AIAA-2016-4839,Mechanisms for Pole Piece Erosion in a 6-kW Magnetically-Shielded Hall Thruster,"The mechanisms contributing to the erosion of the inner magnetic pole of a 6-kW mag-netically shielded Hall thruster are experimentally and numerically investigated. Sputter-ing from ion bombardment is believed to be the cause of this wear, but the nature andsource of the responsible ions remains unknown. Laser induced uorescence and trans-lating and surface-mounted probes are employed to characterize the ion ux and energydistribution incident at the inner pole. It is found that the bulk population is comprisedof ions originating from the cathode plume and the near  eld immediately adjacent to theinner pole. These ions have a low average kinetic energy, < 5 eV, but a high thermalspread in velocity, Ti = 10 eV. Calculations for the erosion at the pole from experimentalmeasurements indicate that the bulk population only accounts for 5 ? 25% of the observederosion. It is postulated that the remainder of the erosion results from a separate popu-lation of ions with su ciently high energy (> 100 V) to cause high sputtering but too lowdensity to be resolved experimentally by the plasma diagnostics. The existence of this highenergy population is shown to be a consequence of the high plasma potentials downstreamof the thruster exit plane that are characteristic of a magnetically-shielded topography.A thruster simulation validated by experimental measurements provides further evidencethat a high energy ion population exists at the pole with su cient density to explain theobserved erosion.","Mechanisms for Pole Piece Erosion in a 6-kW"

The AsteroidRedirect Robotic mission is one candidate SEP TDM, which is projected to require tens ofthousands of thruster life. As thruster life is increased, for example through the use ofimproved magnetic field designs, the relative influence of facility effects increases. One sucheffect is the sputtering and redeposition, or back sputter, of facility materials by the highenergy thruster plumes.

Low-powermodels, BBM1, are intended to replace ion thrusters for NSSK, or to be main propulsionsystems for small/medium class deep space explorers. In contrast, higher-power model,BBM2, is going to obtain both high-thrust mode (up to 480 mN and 1,300s or higher) andhigh-Isp mode (120 mN and 2,500s) corresponding to quick orbital raising fromgeostationary transfer orbit (GTO) to geostationary earth orbit (GEO), followed by efficientNSSK operation after insertion into GEO. Laboratory testings of BBM2 were conducted at apower level up to 6.9 kW, and thrust value as much as 473 mN was obtained for a xenonmass flow rate of 30 mg/s, and for a reduced flow rate and a higher acceleration voltage, anIsp of 2,330s was obtained.

This is the first test of a NASA-designed magnetically shielded thruster to extend beyond 300 hr of continuous operation.Trends in performance, component wear, thermal design, plume properties, and back-sputtered deposition are discussed for two wear-test segments of 246 h and 360 h. The first incorporated graphite pole covers in an electrical configuration where cathode was electrically connected to thruster body. The second utilized traditional alumina pole covers with the thruster body floating. It was shown that the magnetic shielding in both configurations completely eliminated erosion of the boron nitride discharge channel but resulted in erosion of the inner pole cover. The volumetric erosion rate of the graphite pole covers was roughly 2/3 that of the alumina pole covers and the thruster exhibited slightly better performance. Buildup of back-sputtered carbon on the BN channel at a rate of roughly 1.5 ¦Ìm/kh is shown to have negligible impact on the performance.","Hani Kamhawi, 4 Wensheng Huang, 5 Drew W.

The resulting cold-flow model is simulatedusing OpenFOAM, an open source platform for the solution of fluid dynamics problems. The accuracy ofthe solver is validated through comparisons to existing analytical models. After the validation is complete,simulations are run to examine the response of the vortex to changes in the injector design.

2776,AIAA-2016-5080,Performance Evaluation of Rocket Engine Combustors  using Ethanol/Liquid Oxygen Pintle Injector,"The pintle injector has various attractive features as a propellant injector of a liquid rocket engine such as the simple structure and the combustion stability. Since few fundamental studies on the pintle injector have been conducted, most of the design parameters of the pintle injector are determined based on the empirical knowledge. Therefore, combustion experiments with a planar pintle injector, which is designed for optical measurements of a pintle injector, are conducted to clarify combustion behaviors under various operating conditions. Another combustion experiment is also conducted using an axisymmetric combustor with a pintle injector to compare the combustion characteristics of the planar pintle injector and the axisymmetric pintle injector. The target combustion pressure and O/F is 0.5 MPa and 1.45, respectively. Denatured ethanol and liquid oxygen are used as the propellant. The injection configuration is oxidizer-centered in both tests. The effects of total momentum ratio (TMR) on the combustion characteristics are investigated by changing the propellant injection velocity. It is clarified that characteristic exhaust velocity efficiency of the planar pintle injector decreases with an increase in TMR due to the impingement of the propellant droplets on the combustor wall, which is observed with a high-speed imaging technique. The same tendency is observed in the axisymmetric pintle injector, therefore, the test method with the planar pintle injector is a promising testing method for a pintle injector to investigate fundamental combustion characteristics. Longitudinal combustion instability is observed during the tests with the axisymmetric pintle injector. The amplitude of the pressure fluctuation increases with decreasing LOX injection pressure. Not only the acoustic modes but also injection coupling combustion instability is observed during the unstable combustion. The amplitude of the pressure fluctuation during the stable combustion is less than 50 % of that of the unstable case, however, the pressure fluctuation with the frequency of 400 Hz, which is not dominant in the unstable case, is observed. The frequency corresponds to the convective time scale of the combustion gas, which means that the oscillation at the frequency can be caused by the entropy wave.","Performance Evaluation of Rocket Engine Combustors "

2782,AIAA-2016-4681,"Integrated Pressure-Fed Liquid Oxygen / Methane Propulsion Systems - Morpheus Experience, MARE, and Future Applications","An integrated liquid oxygen (LOx) and methane propulsion system, in which common propellants are fed by pressure to both the reaction control system and main engines, offers advantages in performance, simplicity, and reusability. A LOx/Methane-based architecture provides the capability to use propellants that are manufactured on the Mars surface for ascent return and for support of power and life support systems. The non-toxic nature of the propellants improves the safety of operations on the surface and in space. These clean burning and high vapor pressure propellants provide significant advantages for reliable ignition in a space vacuum and for simple purging of a space-based vehicle to make it safe and reusable. The NASA Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Morpheus lander demonstrated many of these key attributes as it completed over 65 tests, including 15 flights through 2014. Morpheus is a prototype of a LOx/Methane propellant lander vehicle with a fully integrated propulsion system. The key technologies are a simple pressure-fed cryogenic reaction control feed system and thrusters which can be integrated with the main engine, a common propellant supply that uses passive space-storable cryogenic storage technologies, and a cold GHe storage and warm gas pressurization system. The Morpheus lander flight demonstrations led to the proposal to use LOx/Methane for a Discovery class mission, named Moon Aging Regolith Experiment (MARE), proposed by Southwest Research Institute to land an in-situ science payload for the Southwest Research Institute on the lunar surface. Lox/Methane is extensible to human spacecraft for many transportation elements of a Mars architecture. This paper discusses LOx/Methane propulsion systems in regards to trade studies, the Morpheus project experience, the MARE NAVIS (NASA Autonomous Vehicle for In-situ Science) lander, and future possible applications. The paper also discusses the current state of the technology and the future needs for LOx/Methane propulsion systems.","Integrated Pressure-Fed Liquid Oxygen / Methane "

Results from this hot-fire test series were used to validate integrated models of the vehicle helium and propulsion systems and demonstrate system effectiveness for a throttling lander. Pressurization systems vary greatly in complexity and efficiency between vehicles, so a pressurization performance metric was reviewed as a means to compare different active pressurization schemes. This implementation of an active repress system is an initial sizing draft. Refined implementations will be tested in the future, improving the general knowledge base for a cryogenic lander-based cold helium system.","Cold Helium Pressurization for Liquid Oxygen / Liquid "

2785,AIAA-2016-4593,Measurements of Dielectric Properties of Condensed Phase Aluminized Composite Propellants,"Advanced propellant combustion control technologies are required for progression of the solid propulsion field. Previous work has shown using propellants doped with alkali earth metals (e.g. sodium nitrate, NaNO3), composite propellant flames can be made to have strong coupling with microwaves irradiation, and it has been demonstrated that using such a doping technique with sub-critical microwave excitation, the atmospheric burning rate of a composite solid propellant can be enhanced by 67%. Still, little literature exist on composite propellant condensed phase dielectric properties. In this study, the microwave properties of two aluminized ammonium perchlorate composite propellants being studied as candidates for microwave seeded plasma enhancement of propellant flames are considered. The dielectric properties of propellants are measured in the S-band between 2.3 and 2.65 GHz with an Anritsu Shockline vector network analyzer using the cavity perturbation technique. Using measured bulk propellant properties, finite difference models are developed to predict the field distribution within both a RF-modulated propellant strand combustion cavity and RF heating of the propellant utilizing COMSOL 5.1 Multiphysics to simulate conditions of propellants strand in a TE10n mode cavity for an experiment in a continuous microwave cavity.","Measurements of Dielectric Properties of Condensed Phase "

This study offers a guide on sample preparation after fabrication and microscope usage. A qualitative comparison of dry powder additives against in-situ additives, in terms of dispersion, using SEM with an elemental overlay from the EDS was performed. Oxygen atoms were used to distinguish ammonium perchlorate (AP) from the binder, and carbon was used to observe the HTPB binder locations. Additives under investigation included TiO2, Fe2O3 and conventional powdered aluminum. It was found that catalytic additives synthesized through the in-situ process appear to be better dispersed than those added as a dry powder. Artificially aged propellants were also observed in addition to bi-modal propellants.","MODERN SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IN "
2787,AIAA-2016-4595,Pyrotechnic Dispersion and Ignition of Boron Particles in Gels,"This study addresses the use of a shrinking core model in order to evaluate the combustion behavior of boron pyrotechnic clusters suspended in a kerosene-based gel fuel. Boron particles are combined in a low oxidizer pyrotechnic mixture forming clusters that are dispersed in the gel droplet. During the combustion of the gel droplet, the organic phase evaporates from the droplet surface, forming a porous layer of dry particles. The pyrotechnic clusters are designed to ignite after the formation of the dry layer when boron particles are not bonded by any liquid phase and can be easily dispersed. It has been established that the time needed to reach initial boron scattering depends on the droplet diameter and absorbed heat flux. No dependence of the time delay for initial boron scattering on boiling temperature was observed. Three pyrotechnics activation temperatures were evaluated in order to ensure the formation of the dry layer. Boron pyrotechnics based on NH4ClO4 was limited to low gels boiling temperature whereas pyrotechnics based on NaClO4 or KClO4, which have a higher activation temperature, can ensure the formation of a dry layer so that the boron particles can be scattered.","Pyrotechnic Dispersion and Ignition  "

For simplicity, the analysis is modelled using an open tube geometry. The analysis employs the Rankine-Hugoniot Equation, Rayleigh Line Equation, and Zel¡¯dovich¨Cvon Neumann¨CDoering model and takes into account species mole, mass fraction, and enthalpies-of-formation of the reactants. Initially, minimum conditions for the detonation of each fuel are determined. Pressure, temperature, and density ratios at each stage of the combustion tube for different types of fuel are then explored systematically. Finally, the influence of different initial conditions is numerically examined to make a comparison for these fuels.","Comparative Analysis of Alternative Fuels in Detonation "
2789,AIAA-2016-5105,Numerical Simulation of Blast-Wave-Particle and Contact Interaction Induced by a Detonation in Condensed Matter,"In this paper we present planar and axisymmetric numerical simulations of detonationinducedblast-wave-particle and contact interaction. The numerical method is a finitevolumebased solver with diffuse material interface model. Validation of the solver isdemonstrated by comparing to existing experimental data. We compute the unsteadyinviscid drag coefficient as a function of time, and show that the force due to contact impacton particles is orders of magnitude higher than that by interaction with the transimittedshock in air, and the pressure in the particle due to contact impact is on the order of theshock pressure in the explosive, leading to significant compaction of the pack. Also, theinteraction of layers of particles introduces additional subsequent drag and pressure peaks.The maximum drag coefficient increases with packing fraction, and the higher the packingfraction, the closer the value of CD to that of 1-D. We also demonstrated that the drag ishigher in planar than in axisymmetric geometry, as expected and similar to the well knownresults of flow past cylinder versus sphere.","Numerical Simulation of Blast-Wave-Particle and"
2790,AIAA-2016-5258,On the Mitigation of Solar Index Variability for High Precision Orbit Determination in Low Earth Orbit,"E ective satellite mission operations are directly impacted by the ability to gen-erate accurate and precise orbit predictions. High precision orbit determinationprocesses rely on detailed force models to propagate an orbit solution and pre-dict future orbit behavior. While gravity forces are typically well understood, themodeling of non-conservative forces is often more challenging, causing increaseddi culty in achieving and maintaining high precision orbit predictions for satellitesoperating in low Earth orbit. In particular, the atmosphere models used to predictthe drag force experienced by a satellite may rely on input parameters such as solarux and geomagnetic indices, which are often di cult to predict. Multiple meth-ods of selecting the solar ux and geomagnetic index parameters are examined incombination with a number of current and historically recommended atmosphericdensity models to assess the impact of uncertainty in the predicted index values.Geodetic satellites with high precision satellite laser ranging data are used as testcases for the Naval Research Laboratory's Orbit Covariance Estimation and ANal-ysis (OCEAN) tool to evaluate solution accuracy and predictive capabilities of eachcombination. In all test cases examined, using either the Naval Research Labora-tory Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter Radar 2000 or Jacchia-Bowman2008 atmospheric density model with solar ux and geomagnetic index values heldconstant, rather than using the predicted index values, provided the most accurateorbit predictions. Surprisingly, the exponential atmospheric density model, whichdoes not take into account atmospheric parameters, yielded more accurate orbitpredictions than any model using predicted solar ux and geomagnetic indices.","On the Mitigation of Solar Index Variability for High"
2791,AIAA-2016-4906,Development of Propulsion System with Bi-propellants Based on Green Propellant for Microsatellite,"Development of under-50kg-class microsatellites is now rapidly increasing in the world because it can be attained at a lower cost and in a shorter term than before, and some of missions using microsatellites requires a propulsion system, so that we have been developing a propulsion system based on 60 wt% hydrogen peroxide under the policies of SAFETY FIRST and EFFECTIVE COTS. While our mono-propellant system were already launched in 2014, installed onto HODOYOSHI-1 and HODOYOSHI-3, we are now preparing a bi-propellant propulsion system with the higher specific impulse over 200 seconds by using the 60 wt% hydrogen peroxide and ethanol. We improved the design of thruster and feed system for the bi-propellant system, and conducted ignition tests to obtain the performances of the improved bi-propellant propulsion system. As the result, we obtained the highest ISP of 129 seconds when O/F(wt) was 17.9 in one experiment, and the highest combustion temperature of 1,800 K, meaning 101 seconds of specific impulse in another experiment. Though we succeeded to attain a stable combustion when ISP reached 129 seconds at the highest, the suitable O/F(wt) was about 20, which was 3 times larger than O/F(st). This suggests a problem that the decomposition of 60 wt% hydrogen peroxide was not sufficient and the flow rate of 60 wt% hydrogen peroxide became unstable. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the problem in order to realize the stable combustion in our bi-propellant propulsion system for microsatellites.","Development of Propulsion System with Bi-Propellants "

There is considerable emphasis from the user community on TRLs as an identi cationof the system maturity; however, the propulsion community has not developed a consistentde nition of the TRLs for micro-propulsion. This work seeks to expand on the generalguidance provided by Department of Defense documentation and provide speci c guidancefor spacecraft micro-propulsion systems. This expansion of the Department of Defenseguidelines is consistent in that the general guide for TRLs is to be interpreted by subjectmatter experts.

2793,AIAA-2016-4598,3D Flame Spread and Starting Transient in Dual-thrust Solid Propellant Rocket Motors,"Numerical studies have been carried out to examine the 3D flame spread mechanism and the starting pressure transient of high-performance dual-thrust solid propellant rocket motors after invoking the unsteady mass injection based on the local transient pressure. Parametric analytical studies have been carried out in dual-thrust motors (DTMs) with large length-to-diameter ratio (L/d > 44) using a validated three-dimensional unsteady, shear-stress transport k¨C¦Ø turbulence model. In the numerical study, a fully implicit finite volume scheme of the compressible, density based Navier¨CStokes equations is employed. We reconfirmed that, at the subsonic inflow conditions, there is a possibility of the occurrence of internal flow choking in high-performance DTMs due to the formation of a fluid throat at the beginning of the transition region induced by area blockage caused by boundary layer-displacement thickness. In all the DTM cases, immediately after the internal flow choking and during the flame spread period, we have observed very sharp pressure spikes downstream of the transition region followed by high pressurization rate (dP/dt) with different amplitude. We observed that the internal flow choking will leads to shock waves causing sharp pressure spike and high pressurization rate during the starting transient period of operation of DTMs. The shock waves and the new turbulence level will alter the location of the reattachment/secondary ignition point and also enhance the heat flux to the propellant surface, which in turn will alter the 3D flame spread mechanism and the transient burning. We observed that under certain conditions in DTMs the choked flow developed due to fluid-throat effect becomes unchoked flow during the ignition transient due to the thinning of the boundary layer-displacement thickness as a result of unsteady transient mass injection from the propellant surface during flame spreading and/or chamber filling interval, as the case may be. We concluded that one can eliminate the undesirable pressure spike and the pressure-rise rate in such DTMs by prudently negating the fluid-throat effect by an early breaking the boundarylayer and subsequently altering the 3D flame spread mechanism.","3D Flame Spread and Starting Transient in Dual-thrust "

A computer-oriented dynamic model is developedfor simulation and controller design, and the e ect of CMGs is introduced through torqueequation neglecting the varying part of CMGs' inertia. The translational degrees of freedomof the platform are decoupled from the system dynamic equation, since platform orienta-tion and manipulator motion are the major considerations in many cases. A model-basedcontroller with acceleration-level redundancy resolution of the manipulator is developedfor coordinate control of platform orientation and manipulator motion. The platform canmaintain a  xed orientation while the manipulator tracks an operational space trajectory.To deal with the saturation problem of the CMGs, manipulator redundancy is used toequalize the CMGs momentum usage among manipulator links by decreasing a momentumequalization index. Simulation is used to verify the control technique.","Dynamics and Momentum Equalization Control of"

The rigid body motion of the chaseris parameterized using quaternion kinematics to produce bounded and periodic attitudetrajectory profiles for a natural relative motion with constant angular rates. Linearizationabout the constant relative angular rates results in a linear time invariant, multiple-inputmultiple-output dynamical system. By considering the corresponding periodic attitudeprofiles as persistent harmonic disturbances, adaptive disturbance accommodation is usedwithin the AAC to condition the controller to track the reference signal and improve overallperformance. The stability of the system is analyzed during the design process and confirmedthrough numerical simulations. The performance of the system is evaluated for atarget tracking scenario involving a 6U CubeSat capable of 3 degrees-of-freedom rotationalmaneuvering; the satellite is simultaneously subjected to environmental sinusoidal disturbances.The results presented show improved tracking performance and input reductionin comparison to a fixed-gain control system for both, linear and non-linear plants.","Adaptive Augmenting Control of Satellite Attitude for"

A space station at a halo-orbit and an active spacecraft (AS) in the vicinity of the orbit are considered. An iterative algorithm of differential correction is used. The numerical method is based on the precisely Moon and Sun ephemerides. As the optimization technique, the pseudo-impulse set method (discretization of the trajectory on segments and a near-uniform discrete approximation of the possible thrust directions for each segment) is applied. The method requires computation of the partial derivatives for all of the pseudo-impulses at each segment along a reference trajectory. The partial derivatives can be computed numerically for perturbed motion equations. Application examples are presented for low-thrust rendezvous trajectories with durations of 1-4 days after the transfer to a vicinity of the halo-orbit. Results of the method convergence are described. The linear approximation (i.e. the solution at the first iteration) has a good precision ¨C no more than 1% of target state vectors.

In a large space outpostpass-through connection is needed between multiple volumes to maintain a continuouspressurized cabin for crew access, translation, and egress. Zero-g docking and berthing ofelements can be done using robotic arms, thrusters, and simple docking interface hardwarebecause orthogonal mating is only governed by position, orientation, and momentum, butsoft capture / hard docking techniques would not work in a gravity environment becausemodules cannot be brought in square with each other. Gravity docking is problematic in thatany two elements have a gravity vector and it is not practical to provide a perfectly flatsurface for them to rest on. Any stretch of natural or graded terrain still has surfacefluctuations -- maneuvering one element in respect to another would constantly be workingagainst a gravity vector, where uneven surfaces would cause modules to come to rest in oddconfigurations in respect to each other. Manipulation of heavy elements, such as habitats willbe difficult to do with precision -- elements may be placed as close as the mobility system canhandle but would still leave the elements not in square with each other.

For missions to Mars(such as NASA's Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC)), where timely resupply or abort in theevent of emergency will not be possible, maintenance logistics mass is directly linked to theProbability of Loss of Crew (P(LoC)), and the cost of driving down risk is an exponential in-crease in mass requirements. The logistics support strategies that have maintained humanoperations in LEO will not be e ective for these deep space missions. In-Space Manufac-turing (ISM) is a promising technological solution that could reduce logistics requirements,mitigate risks, and augment operational capabilities, enabling Earth-independent humanspaceight. This paper reviews maintenance logistics challenges for spaceight operationsin LEO and beyond, and presents a summary of selected results from a systems analysisof potential ISM applications for the ISS and EMC. A quantitative modeling frameworkand sample assessment of maintenance logistics and risk reduction potential of this newtechnology is also presented. In the Mars transit habitat case study examined here, ISMenabled a 28% reduction in maintenance logistics mass when applied to approximately onethird of the components within the system, and the addition of materials recycling capa-bility increased this to 34%.

The project team began with thedevelopment of a baseline design for a two-person inflatable airlock, with a NASA International Docking Systemon one end and the egress hatch on the other. A series of human factors evaluations in the University ofMaryland Neutral Buoyancy Research Facility were performed to examine the required size for the inflatableairlock. The system was sized for two pressure-suited crew, and an overall configuration of 1.5 m in diameterand 2 m long was selected. The design activity looked at both planetary surface and microgravity airlockapplications. While an axial airlock configuration (hatches in the ends of the cylindrical configuration) werepreferred for both microgravity applications and overall ease of fabrication, radial egress (rectangular hatches1x1.5 m in the cylindrical walls) was preferred for operations in higher gravities.","Design and Testing of an In?atable Airlock Concept"

Advantages of transitioning to LED technologies in spacecraft are reduced mass, reduced occupied volume, reduced power, improved color control, longer operating life, and lower cost associated with power consumption and disposal. This research provides empirical evidence that selected commercial LEDs are capable of meeting NASA and DOD environmental test requirements supported by additional analysis for human factors in search of adverse effects, such as fatigue, eye strain, and headaches in astronauts.

Large payloads can theoretically save cost by reducing the number of launches needed--but only if it is possible to build, test, and transport a large payload to the launch site in the first place. Analysis performed previously for the Altair project identified several transportation and test issues with an 8.973 m diameter payload.

In addition, IVF increases the upper stage capability to enable long duration spaceflight. IVF is a single system that replaces three independent upper stage subsystems, the helium pressurization system, the reaction control system and the electrical power storage subsystem. IVF is critical to this long duration capability and is essential for the Advanced Cryogenic Upper Stage (ACES) that will replace Centaur and increase performance for the Vulcan booster. This capability is revolutionary and is a departure from the incremental evolution of the existing Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle cryogenic upper stages. This paper will explore the basic concept of operations and results of development and proof of concept testing recently accomplished.

The motivation of thisconceptual study is to understand the geometric configuration of a generator as a function ofpressure ratio in a first-order approximation. The objective is to quantify the generatedelectrical power in MHD devices in a simplified analysis. Two design cases were assessed forchannel length, area inlet and outlet geometries, current densities in the transverse direction,and the maximum electrical power. The flow analyses assumed constant and uniformproperties throughout the MHD generator for given oxy-methane combustion products inchemical equilibrium. In the analysis of a MHD inlet system of 5 mm, considering an externalmagnetic field of 3 Tesla and an electrical conductivity of 20 S/m, the resulting characteristicsthrough the square MHD generator channel were approximated. For this case, the TransverseFaraday current, the maximum electrical power generated, and the outlet static temperaturewere approximated to be 102 amperes, 1531 watts, and 2431 K, respectively. However, as theMHD inlet system is increased in magnitude by a factor of ten, transverse Faraday current of1020 amperes and a maximum electrical power of 153 kilowatts was generated. The inviscidflow analysis may be used as a first order approximation to develop experimental MHDdevices at the small scale. The broader impacts of MHD generators is the possibility toaugment turbine-driven combined cycles for enhanced efficiency and reduction of emissionsin base load power generation.

2828,AIAA-2016-4605,Heat Pipe Embedded Thermoelectric Generator for Diesel Generator Set Waste Heat Recovery,"Power generation is an essential requirement for the sustainment of all remote military operations and is typically provided by diesel-fueled generator sets. By investing in methods to enhance the efficiency of electrical power generation, future systems can reduce costs and improve the safety of military assets and personnel. Current diesel generator sets only utilize a fraction of the energy released by fuel, a large portion of which is exhausted as heat in combusted gases. This heat, normally wasted, can be harvested and converted to additional electrical power for improvements to fuel efficiency. Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc.

Combination of fuel cells with gas turbines shown higher efficiencies than conventional gas turbines. A one-dimensional dynamic model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) integrated with a motor driven compressor and exhaust nozzle for efficient electrical power generation for aircraft has been proposed. As an initial step toward this system, the SOFC - combustor model was developed based on first principles with detailed modeling of the internal steam reformer, electro chemical and thermodynamics of the SOFC included. Dynamic modeling based on transient numerical analysis equations derived from first principles makes the model more robust.

2832,AIAA-2016-5004,Air Cycle Machine Transient Modeling with Exergy Analysis,"System optimization and design of aircraft is required to achieve many of the long term objectives. To address the necessity for system optimization a vehicle-level aircraft model has been developed in a multidisciplinary modeling and simulation environment. Individual subsystem models developed exclusively in MATLAB/Simulink, representing the vehicle dynamics, the propulsion, electrical power, and thermal systems, and their associated controllers, are combined to investigate the energy and thermal management issues of tactical air vehicle platforms. A thermal vehicle level tip-to-tail model allows conceptual design trade studies of various subsystems and can quantify performance gains across the aircraft. Often one of the main objectives is system efficiency for reduction in fuel use for a given mission. System efficiency can be quantified by either a 1st or 2nd law thermodynamic analysis. A 2nd law exergy analysis can provide a more robust means of accounting for all of the energy flows within and in between subsystems. These energy flows may be thermal, chemical, electrical, pneumatic, etc. Energy efficiency gains in the transient domain of the aircraft's operation provide untapped opportunities for innovation. In order to quantify the efficiency gains utilizing a 2nd law exergy analysis must be accounted for in the analysis. This paper demonstrates the implementation of a transient exergy analysis for a thermal management subsystem component.

The system consists of a valved pulse combustor and an ejector,housed within a shroud. The study focuses on two enhancements to previous models, relatedto the valve and ejector components. First, a new poppet inlet valve system is investigated,replacing the previously used reed valve configuration. Secondly, a new computationalapproach to approximating the effects of choked turbine inlet guide vanes presentimmediately downstream of the Ejector-Enhanced Resonant Pulse Combustor (EERPC) isinvestigated. Instead of specifying a back pressure at the EERPC exit boundary (as was donein previous studies) the new model adds a converging-diverging (CD) nozzle at the exit of theEERPC. The throat area of the CD nozzle can be adjusted to obtain the desired backpressure level and total mass flow rate. The results presented indicate that the new poppetvalve configuration performs nearly as well as the original reed valve system, and that theaddition of the CD nozzle is an effective method to approximate the exit boundary effects ofa turbine present downstream of the EERPC. Furthermore, it is shown that the moreacoustically reflective boundary imposed by a nozzle, as compared to a constant pressuresurface, does not significantly affect operation or performance.","Numerical Evaluation of an Ejector-Enhanced Resonant "

Part of the technology maturation was to test the TDU-1 thruster in several ground based electrical configurations to assess the thruster robustness and suitability to successful in-space operation. The ground based electrical configuration testing has recently been demonstrated as an important step in understanding and assessing how a Hall thruster may operate differently in-space compared to ground based testing, and to determine the best configuration to conduct development and qualification testing. This paper describes the electrical configuration testing of the HERMeS TDU-1 Hall thruster in NASA Glenn Research Center¡¯s Vacuum Facility 5.

2842,AIAA-2016-4652,A Network Scheduling Model for Distributed Control Simulation,"Distributed engine control is a hardware technology that radically alters the architecture for aircraft engine control systems. Of its own accord, it does not change the function of control, rather it seeks to address the implementation issues for weight-constrained vehicles that can limit overall system performance and increase life-cycle cost. However, an inherent feature of this technology, digital communication networks, alters the flow of information between critical elements of the closed-loop control. Whereas control information has been available continuously in conventional centralized control architectures through virtue of analog signaling, moving forward, it will be transmitted digitally in serial fashion over the network(s) in distributed control architectures. An underlying effect is that all of the control information arrives asynchronously and may not be available every loop interval of the controller, therefore it must be scheduled. This paper proposes a methodology for modeling the nominal data flow over these networks and examines the resulting impact for an aero turbine engine system simulation.","A Network Scheduling Model for Distributed Control "
2843,AIAA-2016-4855,Investigation of Pressure Drop and Heat Transfer Behavior of a Square Channel with 45Â° Angle Turbulators on One and Two Wall Configuration,"An experimental investigation of friction and heat transfer behavior for a fully developed flow in a square channel was conducted under a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Re) from 6,000 to 150,000. The heated test section was 22 hydraulic diameters (Dh) long, and made of four aluminum plates. The interior comprised of three smooth walls and one bottom wall roughened with glued brass ribs oriented at 45¡ã to the flow direction with a ratio of rib height to channel hydraulic diameter (e/Dh), and ratio of pitch to rib height (p/e) of 0.063 and 10, respectively. A 20Dh long acrylic inlet channel, with geometry matching the test section¡¯s interior, ensures that the flow becomes hydrodynamically developed before entering the test section. Heat transfer tests were conducted under isothermal wall conditions for Reynolds number ranging from 25,000 to 150,000. The results show that after x/Dh = 8.0, the heat transfer coefficient becomes constant, indicating that the heated flow is thermally developed at this point. When compared with Reynolds number, Nusselt number for each heated wall increases in a power law like fashion. The ribbed bottom wall achieves the most heat transfer, while the top smooth wall achieves the least. The left and right walls display comparable heat transfer trends, however the left wall prevails over the right wall because the ribs direct the flow toward the left wall, creating a slight impinging effect. Test section Nusselt number augmentation (Nu/Nu0) decreases, then levels out at value of 1.7 after a Reynolds number of 50,000. However, friction factor enhancement (f/f0), measured at Reynold numbers ranging from 6,000 to 150,000, increases linearly increasing Reynolds number, which reduces the overall thermal performance at higher Reynolds numbers.","Investigation of Pressure Drop and Heat Transfer Behavior "

The jetwas con ned in a cylindrical domain with perpendicular walls 7.5 pipe diameters away fromthe jet centerline. Three-component, time-averaged velocity measurements were obtainedin three dimensions at several million locations using Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry(MRV). The impinging jet ow was fully turbulent with a Reynolds number of 23,000 basedon the pipe diameter. The separation distance between the plate and the jet exit planewas two jet diameters. In this study, experimental data from MRV are compared withReynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations and Improved Delayed DetachedEddy Simulations (IDDES) using the ANSYS Fluent ow solver and four di erent RANSturbulence models. Radial velocity pro les at distances of one and two diameters awayfrom the centerline are found to agree well with the MRV data and hot-wire anemometryexperiments from the literature completed for an uncon ned case (Cooper et al., Int. J.Heat Mass Transer 36, 2675 (1993)). As the radial distance increases, the MRV and the hot-wire results diverged only slightly, and are generally within the experimental uncertaintyfor the MRV data.

Generation of these waves has been shown numerically, supported with analysis, and observed through experiment However, trying to implement a simple formulation based on single fluid ion acoustic waves in a 3-D Hall thruster code without considering Landau damping was only marginally successful; a completely self-consistent solution was not found unless the waves were restricted to grow only downstream of a fixed location in the channel. When Landau damping is included, main ion beam acoustic wave amplitude in the Near Plume is reduced so much that the calculated electrics fields are orders of magnitude greater than measured, and self-consistently calculated potential profiles don¡¯t resemble those of actual Hall thrusters.","Growth and Saturation of Ion Acoustic Waves in Hall "
2846,AIAA-2016-5082,Dynamic Characteristics of Various Liquid Propulsion Engine Cycles as Relates to Pogo Stability Analysis,"Engine dynamic models are one of the necessary components in a pogo stability analysis. Pogo is a nick-name for a fluid-structure interaction often experienced in liquid fueled launch vehicles. The main model elements include the structure, the feedline system, and the engine system. There are a limited number of engine cycles in use in the propulsion industry, including the expander, gas generator and the staged combustion cycles. However, in all of the work found in the literature, there does not appear to be any discussion of the expected dynamic behavior of the variety of engine cycle concepts. This study of three engine cycles (expander, gas generator and staged combustion) reveals some interesting characteristics of these systems in comparison to each other. As expected, the short, stiff flow path of the LO2 system for the expander and gas generator cycles results in a dynamically quiet system. The LH2 systems for all three engine cycles show much more dynamic content. However, a peak in the flow acceptance transfer function accompanies each peak in the pressure transfer function. This suggests that the net effect may not necessarily be a perceptible increase in structural feedback at these frequencies. Finally, the preburner path appears to create a significant barrier to the pressure transmission of the staged combustion system. This makes the full-flow portion of the system dynamically quiet at typical pogo frequencies.","Dynamic Characteristics of Various Liquid Propulsion "

This paper presents a discussion of benchmark and sub-system level experiments with a focus on self-excited combustion dynamics in a multi-element model rocket combustor. The design methodology for the experimental combustor is based on scaling from a full-scale oxidizer-rich staged-combustion engine conditions. The main scaling parameters, fluid, flow, and geometric, are discussed to explain the design methodology and motivation for the multi-element two-dimensional chamber design.","Experimental Investigation of Transverse Combustion "
2848,AIAA-2016-4694,A Hybrid Eulerian-Eulerian/Eulerian-Lagrangian Method for Dense-to-Dilute Dispersed Multiphase Reacting Flows,"Multiphase reacting ows involve multiple physical processes such as injection, breakup,evaporation, mixing, and combustion. These processes occur over a wide range of liquidvolume fractions, with injection and breakup taking place in dense regimes, and most ofevaporation as well as reactions taking place in dilute regimes. Therefore, accurate sim-ulations of such ows require accounting for this dense-to-dilute transition in robust anddynamic manner. In this study, we present extension of a hybrid computational strategy,1, 2which dynamically couples Eulerian-Eulerian (EE) formulation for dense and Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) formulation for dilute regimes, to evaporating particles, thus enabling itto study spray combustion in practical propulsion devices. Another technique, referred asEulerian-Lagrangian with Discrete Equations Method (EL-DEM), previously used in shock-particle interactions to account for dense loading corrections,3 is also extended further forevaporating ows. Both of these methods as well as the baseline EE and EL approachesare compared and results are veri ed through various test cases. Canonical test cases in-clude dispersion of particles in the wake of a blu  body, and dispersion and evaporationof a blob of particles in a channel. Results show reasonable agreement between EE, EL,EL-DEM and hybrid EE-EL approaches for dilute regimes, and suggest the importance ofdense corrections for liquid volume fractions as high as 10%. A comparison is made be-tween the results obtained using di erent hybrid EE-EL transition parameters. Finally, anevaporating spray-jet in a chamber, a con guration similar to diesel engine combustors,4 issimulated using the hybrid approach demonstrating its capability for practical applications.","A Hybrid Eulerian-Eulerian/Eulerian-Lagrangian"
2849,AIAA-2016-5094,Flashback Arrestors for a N2O/C2H4 Premixed Green Propellant,"For more than 50 years hydrazine (N2H4) has been the most favored monopropellant con-cerning propulsion of satellites or planetary probes . Due to changing political framework(e.g.the REACH regulation), growing commercial pressure as well as the need for non-toxicalternatives, currently several so called ""Green Propellants"" for replacing hydrazine areunder investigation. The most developed and prospective candidates are energetic ionicliquids e.g. ADN-based (LMP-103S/FLP-106) or HAN-based (AFM-315E) propellants.Furthermore the Green propellants like hydrogen peroxide or mixtures of nitrous oxidewith hydrocarbons (e.g. NOFBXTM) can o er signi cant advantages compared to classi-cal hydrazine. Aside with ADN-based monopropellants the German Aerospace Center'sInstitute of Space Propulsion in Lampoldshausen is carrying out research on a nitrous ox-ide/ethylene (N2O/C2H4) premixed propellant. The bene ts of this propellant (high ISP> 300s and low toxicity) are facing several challenges, for example the need for a properashback-arrestor and the high combustion temperature (up to 3300K). DLR set up atest bench and designed a combustor to investigated the combustion and ignition behav-ior of the N2O/C2H4 mixture. One main task handling a premixed propellant is avoidingashback at ignition, steady state operation or shutdown of the combustor. To preventashback the combustion chambers' injections system is equipped with porous elements.Thus when designing future thrusters or injection systems, knowledge of the pressure dropacross the porous materials is indispensable. In this paper pressure drop measurementsof  ve di erent gases with several porous materials will be shown and discussed. The re-sults are compared to the classical Forchheimer model and an empirical  t with improvedaccuracy for high speed gas ows will be presented.","Pressure Drop Measurement of Porous Materials:"

Fusion fuels such as Helium 3 (3He) and deuterium can be wrested from the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune and either returned to Earth or used in-situ for energy production. Helium 3 and deuterium were the primary gases of interest with hydrogen being the primary propellant for nuclear thermal solid core and gas core rocket-based atmospheric flight. A series of analyses were undertaken to investigate resource capturing aspects of atmospheric mining in the outer solar system. This included the gas capturing rate, storage options, and different methods of direct use of the captured gases. While capturing 3He, large amounts of hydrogen and 4He are produced. Analyses of orbital transfer vehicles (OTVs), landers, and the issues with in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) mining factories are included. Preliminary observations are presented on near-optimal selections of moon base orbital locations, OTV power levels, and OTV and lander rendezvous points. For analyses of round trip OTV flights from Uranus to Miranda or Titania, a 10- Megawatt electric (MWe) OTV power level and a 200 metric ton (MT) lander payload were selected based on a relative short OTV trip time and minimization of the number of lander flights. A similar optimum power level is suggested for OTVs flying from low orbit around Neptune to Thalassa or Triton. Several moon base sites at Uranus and Neptune and the OTV requirements to support them are also addressed.","Atmospheric Mining in the Outer Solar System:  "

To clarify the regression rate behavior, the experiment was carried out by varying the distance (L0) between the oxidizer injector exit and the grain end surface. The time-averaged axial regression rate showed dependency on L0 and the regression rate correlation was obtained. The local regression rates in the radial direction of the grain end surface were measured. The radial distribution showed the variation having two peaks near the wall and at around r=?0 mm from the grain center.

Gas hybrid rockets using H2O and Mg-Al, which are the planetary resources, are suited to long space navigation and transpotation in the future. However, in our previous studies, the C* combustion efficiency decreased over O/F=1.0. In addition, the evaporation of the metal was not sufficient to react with H2O. We changed the Mg-Al particle size for promoting the reaction of H2O. We obtained the C* combustion efficiency by combustion experiment. The C* combustion efficiency was 76 - 83% at O/F = 1.0 - 2.5 when the Mg-Al mean particle size was 40 ¦Ìm. That was 66 - 76% at O/F = 1.4 ¨C 2.3 when the Mg-Al mean particle size was 68 ¦Ìm.

2858,AIAA-2016-4863,Development of a 75 mm Hybrid Rocket Motor to Test Metal Additives,"The University of KwaZulu-Natal¡¯s Aerospace Systems Research Group is currently running the Phoenix Hybrid Sounding Rocket Programme, which aims to develop a series of sounding rockets for scientific research on the African continent. The Phoenix Programme has thus far developed propulsion systems that combust nitrous oxide with pure paraffin wax. This propellant combination has several desirable characteristics, but its low density compromises launch vehicle performance. Additives such as aluminum, magnesium, and LiAlH4 have previously been experimented with to increase motor performance and propellant density. Although the high energy density of such additives works to enhance performance and propellant density, the formation of non-gaseous oxide slags counteracts performance gains. For a given mission profile therefore, an optimum ratio of paraffin wax to metal additive will exist which minimises the mass of propellant required. The mass percentage and composition of the additive have a significant effect on the regression rate in hybrid rocket fuel grains. A review of literature indicates that the nature of this impact is poorly characterised, despite the fact that adequate knowledge of regression rate behaviour is critical to accurately predicting hybrid rocket motor performance. In order to address these concerns, an experimental study is currently underway that will investigate the performance of metal additives in paraffin wax hybrid rocket fuel grains via a newly established laboratory scale testing platform. Having completed the construction of the testing platform, a cold flow test as well as a hot fire test with a pure paraffin wax fuel grain have been performed. This paper outlines the work undertaken thus far and discusses associated findings.","Development of a 75 mm Hybrid Rocket Motor to Test "

The type and topology of the unstructured mesh andits e ect on the accuracy of the mascon model is examined. Meshes consisting of eithertetrahedral cells or higher-order polyhedral cells with varying degrees of cell-size grad-ing are considered.

2879,AIAA-2016-5317,Exergy Based Analysis for the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems of the International Space Station,"When optimizing the performance of complex systems, a logical area for concern is im-proving the efficiency of useful energy. The energy available for a system to perform work is defined as a system¡¯s exergy content. Interactions between a system¡¯s subsystems and the surrounding environment can be accounted for by understanding various subsystem exergy efficiencies. Exergy balance of reactants and products, and enthalpies and entropies, can be used to represent a chemical process. Heat transfer exergy represents heat loads, and flow exergy represents system flows and filters. These elements allow for a system level exergy balance. The exergy balance equations are developed for the subsystems of the Environmen-tal Control and Life Support (ECLS) system aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The use of these equations with system information would allow for the calculation of the exergy efficiency of the system, enabling comparisons of the ISS ECLS system to other systems as well as allows for an integrated systems analysis for sytem optimization.","Exergy Based Analysis for the Environmental Control and "

2885,AIAA-2016-5445,Indirect and direct planetary illumination modelling for robotic surface exploration sensing,"Robotic exploration of outer planetary bodies will rely on perception systems for autonomous navigation as ground-based control becomes less effective at these long distances due to communication time delay. Passive perception systems for space flight missions using solid-state solutions, such as electro-optical multispectral cameras, are preferred over mechanically scanned systems, such as laser scanners, to remove the risk associated with moving parts. Passive perception systems, however, are reliant on the natural illumination on the planetary body. The illumination can be direct lighting from the sun or indirect lighting from reflected sunlight of a neighboring body. The amount of illumination is also affected by astronomical events such as eclipses. In this paper, we describe our planetary illumination modelling for a general planetary body and reflectance bodies. Our simulation software leverages the JPL NAIF SPICE library to provide high fidelity solar system geometry for the basis of our direct and indirect modelling. Output data products include total, direct, and indirect irradiance plots for a given latitude and longitude on the planetary surface for a given time period and time step.

In particu-lar, the spacecraft attitude controls can be realized through the two dimensional exo-sailmaneuvers in pitch and yaw directions. The uncertain atmospheric drag induced distur-bance torque is estimated through an adaptive parameter estimation process which makesuse of the adaptive least-squares minimization techniques. The covariance updating lawwith a variable forgetting factor is adopted and it can be shown that the convergent ratefor the estimation errors can be chosen at the same level as the forgetting factor, in or-der to meet the design needs. The proposed approach is best suited for Earth orbitingmicro/nano-satellite applications, which are con gured with exo-brake parachute.

Especially, the explorations inside craters, highland regions,and the moon holes are demanded to achieve an unprecedented result that is pivotal ininvestigating the origin of the Earth and the Solar System. These areas, however, arerough terrain. Hence, they are considered to be unsuitable areas for landing. Therefore,for the next generation lunar and planetary landing explorations, the robust touch downtechnology will become more and more important. For the safe landing to such roughand steep terrain, the landing gear is required to prevent the lander from overturningand reduce the impact of landing in the  nal phase of landing sequence.

Six degree of freedom entry simulations of the half-ogiveshape show relatively benign entry environments but predict the vehicle will diverge fromits trim condition late in the entry event if not actively controlled due to a destabilizingcharacteristic of the half-ogive aerodynamics. A simple nitrogen thruster attitude controlsystem is proposed to mitigate the entry instability and maintain attitude control.

The main advantage of usinginterferometry to make astronomic observations is that the achieved spatial resolution doesnot depend on the size of the telescopes, but on the distance between di erent collectors.Applying this technique from space would allow the observation of the far-infrared spectrumat spatial resolutions that were never achieved by previous missions. These observationswould be particularly interesting to better understand the chemical and physical processesrelated to planet and star formation, which can be observed at such infrared frequencies.From a spacecraft design point of view, the main challenges of this mission are twofold.First, it is required to measure the distances between di erent spacecraft very accuratelyin order to perform interferometry. Thanks to the detection method used in IRASSI anactive control of this distance is not required. The second challenge is the compliancewith the required telescope pointing accuracy to observe an infrared source. Due to thescienti c requirements of IRASSI, the distance between spacecraft shall be measured atan accuracy of 5  m and an absolute pointing error below 0.4 arcsec shall be reached.

2900,AIAA-2016-5729,Multiple Gigabit-per-Second Class Data Link Enabling WFIRST at L2,"NASA¡¯s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will be the first of a new generation of missions, expected to generate amounts of data unprecedented in astrophysics from space. This trend is driven by the availability of high resolution large area detectors, commonly generating simultaneous spatial and spectral information, and the desire to have access to data in the least processed form. Although this increase in data volume is new for astrophysics missions, the data volume and associated rates are well within the realm of Earth science and other space missions. While NASA currently plans to launch WFIRST into a geosynchronous orbit, there are many advantages to placing future observatories outside of Earth¡¯s orbit at locations such as the Sun-Earth libration point L2. These advantages include a more benign radiation environment due to the absence of trapped electrons, eclipse-free Sun illumination for power generation and a stable thermal environment because of the much more slowly varying Sun angle. More importantly, a Sun-Earth libration point orbit will allow for longer integration times thereby enhancing many of the WFIRST mission science cases. These advantages can be realized, if a cost effective, high capacity downlink solution is available. Here, we outline our approach to providing link capacities from L2 in excess of 3 Gbps (3x109 bits/s) based on existing, flight proven components. At these rates, even very large data sets can be transmitted in short data bursts, an approach that allows highly efficient scheduling of ground stations.","Multiple Gigabit-per-Second Class Data Link Enabling "

2904,AIAA-2016-5046,Determination of Transient Heat Transfer Rates for a Film Cooled Metal Plate in a Blowdown Facility using Infrared Thermography,"An experimental investigation has been performed to verify heat flux measurements for a metallic filmcooledflat plate using infrared (IR) thermography in a transient facility. Infrared thermography provideshigh-resolution temperature distributions and makes it easy to locate hot spots on the object of interest.Previous work has shown that infrared thermography can produce accurate measurement for an uncooledflat plate or for film-cooled geometries constructed from a low thermal conductivity material or a metalsurface with a constant heat-flux heater. The goal of this project is to lay the groundwork for the use ofinfrared thermography in full-scale rotating experiments by demonstrating that it can measure heat flux forfilm-cooled metallic components with thin walls and no auxiliary heating. This study investigates a stainlesssteel plate with an internal cooling air cavity and five rows of cooling holes using a transonic blowdown windtunnel. During the experiment, the plate is exposed to hot external flow and low temperature cooling airsupplied through a realistic arrangement of film cooling holes. The heat flux on the plate surface isdetermined with a 3D ANSYS transient thermal analysis using the measured infrared temperaturedistribution as the time-dependent top surface boundary conditions. Although the surfaces of the internalcavity and cooling channels are subject to strong jet impingement and forced convection, they are treated asadiabatic for the ANSYS analysis and the analysis time window is kept short enough that through-wallconduction does not affect the plate top surface during the run. It is shown that through-wall conductionfrom the cavity surface and cooling channel walls only impacts the regions immediately upstream of thecooling holes after a relatively long run time. The fidelity of this technique is verified by comparing theresults calculated based on the infrared images to the results obtained from traditional double-sided heat-fluxgauges (HFGs). The infrared and heat-flux gauge measurements agree within 10% for the regions that arenot immediately upstream of cooling holes. When through-wall conduction does impact the results, theadiabatic internal boundary conditions bias the infrared results to a lower heat flux value than the heat-fluxgauges. The measurement method is used to compare cooled and uncooled cases to clearly identify how thefilm cooling spreads and mixes from the rows of cooling holes. Contour plots clearly show interactions amongthe multiple rows of cooling holes and also highlights the possible impacts of manufacturing variation oncooling coverage.","Determination of Transient Heat Transfer Rates for a Film "

This paper details the creation of a generic but realistic high pressure turbine tip clearance model that may be used to facilitate active tip clearance control system research. This model uses a first principles approach to approximate thermal and mechanical deformations of the turbine system, taking into account the rotor, shroud, and blade tip components. Validation of the tip clearance model shows that the results are realistic and reflect values found in literature. In addition, this model has been integrated with a gas turbine engine simulation, creating a platform to explore engine performance as tip clearance is adjusted.

CFD is ane ective means for studying the complex  ow dynamics to identify the causes of the aerody-namic instability and predict their e ects on the engine nacelle inlet design. An importantaspect of this work is to quantify the e ect of random uncertainty in the model parameterson the engine nacelle inlet performance. Currently, numerical approaches based on thegeneralized polynomial chaos (PC) theory are commonly used for parametric uncertaintyquanti cation. However, the number of CFD model simulations required for conventionalPC approaches increases very quickly with the parameter dimensions. Given the fact thateach CFD simulation for practical geometries under a wide range of realistic operatingconditions is very computationally expensive, this renders conventional PC approaches tobe inapplicable for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we address the above com-putational bottleneck by applying a novel dimension reduction based polynomial chaosapproach. This approach begins by performing a high-dimensional model representation(HDMR) of the engine nacelle inlet which leads to quanti cation of the relative impact ofeach random model parameter acting alone on the variance of the CFD simulations. Theresulting impact factors are then used to guide the dimensionality reduction in the param-eter space resulting in the identi cation of only those parameters which are of maximumimportance to the nacelle inlet design. The reduction of the parameter space translatesto a substantially smaller number of CFD simulations required to perform the PC basedparametric uncertainty quanti cation at a fraction of the original costs.","Fast Uncertainty Quanti(cid:28)cation in Engine Nacelle Inlet"

Analysis of axial velocity POD modes revealed the presence of a separatedregion on the low pressure surface of the blade which was most dynamic in rotor 1. Thethickness of this structure was decreased in the near stall operating condition. As the fanapproaches stall the e ects of distortion are lessened which leads to less variation in theoperating condition.

The aim of this paper is to qualitatively study the influences of the serpentine nozzle on the performance of aero-engine. It is commonly known that excessive geometric parameters are included in the double serpentine nozzle design and, as a result, the performance estimation model for serpentine nozzle coupled with aero-engine is established by combining design of experiment (DOE), response surface methodology (RSM) and aero-engine simulation program based on component characters. In coupling model, seven aerodynamic and geometric parameters were involved in the model, e.g. the length-daimeter ratio; the axial length ratio; the offset distance, the exit area and the exit width of the first serpentine paragraph; the exit aspect ratio of the second serpentine paragraph; and nozzle pressure ratio (NPR), are taken into consideration. Results show that the interaction effects between different parameters are evident for both the thrust coefficient and the flux coefficient; the thrust of the aero-engine coupling with the serpentine nozzle reduces 0.85%-1.81%, and the specific fuel consumption (SFC) increases 1.43%-1.92% as compared to the aero-engine coupling with the axisymmetric nozzle.","Performance Estimation for Serpentine Nozzle Coupled with "

Electric thruster research using metallic propellants underlaboratory conditions requires sensitive control of low propellant mass ow rates. Previousmechanical and J  B systems have struggled to control and accurately measure ow ratesless than 100 mg/s. Existing theory describing the behavior of J   B feed systems wasapplied to optimize the physical dimensions and magnetic  eld strength of a prototypeJ   B pump for low mass ow rate operation with liquid lithium. To meet the challengeof measuring the mass ow rate, an inductive probe was incorporated to track the changein the propellant column height in the feed system reservoir to calculate the mass owrate. Successful operation using liquid lithium was demonstrated for mass ow rates of0.21-0.46 mg/s with a maximum error of   0.13 mg/s.","Liquid Metal Mass Flow Measurement Using a J ¡Á B"

This measurement, which is necessary for improving and validat-ing thrust models, is achieved by mechanically isolating the solenoid from the thruster sothat the solenoid can move independently. The deection of the solenoid is compared todeection by known forces to determine the applied- eld thrust component. The thruststand is found to be accurate to  9 mN over a total range of 1200 mN. Two measurementmethods are implemented to account for tare forces resulting from azimuthal currents tothe thruster electrodes and are shown to agree with one another. As a proof-of-concept,the  rst direct measurements of the applied- eld component of the thrust from a 30 kWlithium Lorentz force accelerator operating at 400 A, 8 mg/s lithium mass ow rate, and0.056 T applied- eld strength give a measured force of 108   14 mN.

With the aid of PMIE, the effects of fuel/air momentum ratio and flow axial position on the crosswise distribution characteristic of kerosene spray are analyzed. Research shows that when the fuel is injected into the air crossflow, it will bend to the flow direction and ambient air will be entrained into the jet. Due to the stretching and distribution of the air vortex, a pair of counter rotating vortices is formed, known as the double-kidney vortex. With the increase of fuel/air momentum ratio and flow direction position, the structure becomes more apparent. The spreading area, width, and height of the spray increase with the fuel/air momentum ratio and flow direction position. The empirical correlation of spray dimensionless crosswise width and area are obtained.

This technology could not overcome the main drawbacks concerning very high operational temperatures which limit the lifetime of the generator components and moderate power performances. Hence, sophisticated materials are required in addition to high system maintenance costs. These aspects are crucial for long term operations but may be neglected within typical missile applications, where flight durations may be considered as very short and reuse of the system is not foreseen.This study summarizes results, which were achieved at research on the development of small scale solid rocket motors with attached MHD generator at the nozzle. As propellants various types of composites relying on a variety of oxidizers were used. Additionally, examinations on efficiency due to changes of electrode alignment and permanent magnet configurations were made.

Adding acontrast agent, a liquid with a relatively higher x-ray absorption, to the grain was thoughtto be an improvement to the study because in theory the agent would occupy the same areasas the liquid in Archimedes Method, which would reduce the experimental disagreement.It would also simulate the regions that the oxidizer would have access to when passingthrough the grain.","Computed Tomography Characterization of a Porous"

One of the most important problems in the design and development of an aero engine combustion chamber is to achieve uniform temperature pattern in circumferential direction and a radial temperature profile in traverse direction with a peak in the middle. The exit temperature profile affects the turbine nozzle guide vane and the overall engine life time. Moreover, Large Eddy Simulation(LES), is a substantial technique for prediction of reacting flow simulations that contain turbulent mixing and combustion process.

Nominal test articles were tested using 100 micron nominal fuel pore sizes. Pressures tested ranged from 207 kPa to 1054 kPa, and oxidizer injection velocities ranged from 7.5 m/s to 16.8 m/s. Regression rates were determined using pretest and posttest length measurements of the solid fuel. Experimental results supported previous work demonstrating that the regression rate of the porous axial-injection, end-burning hybrid was a function of the chamber pressure as opposed to the oxidizer mass flux typical in conventional hybrids. Regression rates ranged from approximately 0.21 mm/s at 207 kPa to 1.44 mm/s at 1054 kPa. The experimental results were compared to an analytical model developed in previous work for qualitative agreement. The model showed qualitative agreement with the experimental results indicating it has potential for giving insight into the flame structure in this propellant combination.","Experimental Evaluation of a Polyethylene/Nitrous Oxide "

Currently, NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center is developinga scaled prototype of a high lift-to-drag ratio glider designed as a flexible launch platformfor nano-scale satellites. Significant launch-energy savings are achieved when the carrieraircraft delivers the NanoSat launch stage to Mach number, angle-of-attack, pitch angle,and flight path angle that approximate the flight conditions achieved along an optimizedground launch trajectory, but at the air-launch altitude. The glider platform alone isunable to achieve the required flight path angle and airspeed, and the launch assistpropulsion system is required as a ""stage 0"" to place the launch vehicle at the optimal flightconditions. A hybrid rocket system was selected because of the inherent safety, operationalsimplicity, and environmental friendliness of the propellants, and the ability for on-demandthrottle and re-start. Gaseous oxygen and additively manufactured ABS are used as thepropellants. This study develops and tests the closed-loop throttle control law required toachieve the initial release conditions.

2923,AIAA-2016-4764,CFD Analysis of Mixing Characteristics of Several Fuel Injectors at Hypervelocity Flow Conditions,"CFD analysis is presented of the mixing characteristics and performance of three fuel injectorsat hypervelocity flow conditions. The calculations were carried out using the VULCAN-CFD solverand Reynolds-Averaged Simulations (RAS). The high Mach number flow conditions match thoseproposed for the planned experiments conducted as a part of the Enhanced Injection and MixingProject (EIMP) at the NASA Langley Research Center. The EIMP aims to investigate scramjet fuelinjection and mixing physics, improve the understanding of underlying physical processes, and developenhancement strategies and functional relationships relevant to flight Mach numbers greaterthan eight. Because of the high Mach number flow considered, the injectors consist of a fuel placementdevice, a strut; and a fluidic vortical mixer, a ramp. These devices accomplish the necessarytask of distributing and mixing fuel into the supersonic cross-flow albeit via different strategies.Both of these devices were previously studied at lower flight Mach numbers where they exhibitedpromising performance in terms of mixing efficiency and total pressure recovery. For comparison,a flush-wall injector is also included. This type of injector generally represents the simplest methodof introducing fuel into a scramjet combustor, however, at high flight Mach number conditions, thedynamic pressure needed to induce sufficient fuel penetration may be difficult to achieve along withother requirements such as achieving desired levels of fuel-to-air mixing at the required equivalenceratio. The three injectors represent the baseline configurations planned for the experiments. Thecurrent work discusses the mixing flow field behavior and differences among the three fuel injectors,mixing performance as described by the mixing efficiency and the total pressure recovery, andperformance considerations based on the thrust potential.","CFD Analysis of Mixing Characteristics of Several Fuel Injectors at"

2926,AIAA-2016-5071,Experimental Investigation of Fuel Cooled Combustor,"Hydrocarbon propelled scramjet engines are suitable for high-speed hypersonic flight. Yet, when flight velocities increase over Mach 5, vehicle thermal protection becomes very critical, as the incoming air cannot be used to cool down the engine. Consequently, scramjet engines cooling must be obtained by using the fuel as a coolant. In this sense, regenerative cooling is one of the most widely applied cooling technique; the fuel acts both as propellant and coolant, passing through cooling channels located between the inner and the outer wall of the engine, before being injected in the combustion chamber. In this context, a regeneratively cooled combustor allowing the experimental study of a regeneratively cooled scramjet has been designed. Tests are realized under both stationary and transient conditions using ethylene as fuel and air as oxidizer. The effect on combustor dynamics of two operating parameter, i.e. fuel mass flow rate (which is varied between 0.010 and 0.040 g.s-1) and equivalence ratio (which is varied between 1.0 and 1.5), has been investigated. It was observed that an increase in fuel mass flow rate between 16 and 20 % results in a raise of the heat flux density passing from the burned gases to the combustor wall between 2 and 28 %, due to a general increase in burned gases temperatures (about 5 to 20%). It was seen that, when equivalence ratio passes from 1.0 to 1.5, the average ratio between the heat flux density lost with the exhaust gases and the total heat flux density generated by fuel combustion passes from 0.24 to 0.15, depending on the operating conditions. The heat exchange efficiency of the cooling system has been evaluated. A hysteresis effect due to the heat transfer dynamics has been demonstrated.","Experimental Investigation of Fuel Cooled Combustor "

Special consideration was given to ensure the cross-ow boundary layer could be predicted and the jet was entirely liquid upon injection. Thecrossow speed, temperature and jet velocity were varied to demonstrate the e ect of ther-mal di erences on a jet in crossow. High speed back-lit photography and Mie scatteringwere used to examine the primary breakup regimes, trajectory and breakup points. Thebreakup regimes show little change from conventional jets in crossow near thermodynamicequilibrium. Penetration of the jet increased with an increase in crossow temperature butshowed less dependence on momentum ux ratio than conventional jets in crossow. Thebreakup points in the streamwise direction followed trends previously observed for ther-mal equilibrium jets in crossows. However the height of column fracture did not increasewith momentum ux ratio as much as would be expected, and the breakup time showeda decrease with increasing momentum ux ratio The di erences observed were attributedto the development of a sheath of evaporated uid around the main liquid core of the jet.","Trajectory and Breakup of Cryogenic Jets in Cross?ow"

2936,AIAA-2016-5114,Effect of Particle Size on Microwave Seeded Plasma Enhancement of Composite Propellant Combustion,"The development of game-changing throttling and performance enhancing technologies that are applicable to a variety of propellants formulations is required to for the advancement of solid propulsion. Previous work has demonstrated that using alkali earth metal doping techniques, composite propellant flames can be made to have strong electromagnetic coupling properties, resulting in significant enhancement of atmospheric pressure flame structure accompanied by ~70% enhancements in burning rate. In this technique, high localized flame temperatures provide the energy required to ionize alkali earth metals (e.g. sodium provided by a sodium nitrate, NaNO3, dopant), producing free electrons within the flame that act as targeted microwave energy deposition sites for the microwave-supported formation of burning rate enhancing thermal plasmas. In this study, the atmospheric pressure combustion of composite propellants comprised of ammonium perchlorate (AP), aluminum (Al), and sodium nitrate dopant with different particle sizes are investigated under application of 1 kW, 2.45 GHz 60 Hz modulated radiation. Specifically, a variety of spectroscopic techniques, including UV-VIS and IR spectroscopy as well as two-color high speed video pyrometry are employed in order to explore the propellant flame enhancement occurring from microwave plasma propellant flame enhancement. Results indicate the plasma formation occurs at high localized temperature from Al combustion due to the ionization of Na+ and rapid grow due to subsequently enhanced microwave coupling. During plasma coupling events, temperature enhancements of ~800 K above steady state temperature are observed from gray body fitting of IR emission and from two-color pyrometry. Thermal enhancement is observed to form near the propellant burning surface and is expected to be a significant source of burning rate enhancement observed in our previous studies. Taken together, the technique¡¯s ability to produce dynamic, significant increases in flame temperature and burning rate indicate promise as a technique to both enhance motor thrust/burning rate and establish control over solid motor combustion.","Microwave Seeded Plasma Enhancement of Composite "

Upon the success of synthesizing the in-situ titania in the HTPB binder, now the authors have applied that same process to iron oxide. Results indicate the 15-to-20-nm-sized iron oxide particles grown in-situ indeed increase the burning rate on both aluminized and non-aluminized AP/HTPB-based propellants. SEM imaging was used to view the in-situ iron oxide in the HTPB binder, and it appeared to be well distributed within the binder. As this work represents the first iteration on the iron oxide synthesis process, additional iterations may be needed to unlock the full potential of iron oxide as a catalyst.","Laboratory-Scale Burning of Composite Solid "
2938,AIAA-2016-5205,A Novel Push-or-Pull Asteroid Magnetic Tractor,"The possibility of an asteroid striking the earth is well known. The chosen technique for diverting such an asteroid depends on the lead time measured from the determination that an asteroid has a large probability of colliding and the expected time of such a collision. There are a large number of possible deflection techniques that are available, each suited to different lead times. If the lead time is unpleasantly short, desperation measures such as using nuclear devices may apply. If the lead time is comfortably long, the heralded gravity tractor (GT) is a good option. It is capable of precisely and verifiably altering the orbit of a threatening asteroid. If the lead time happens to be somewhere between desperate and comfortable, it is not clear what option may be invoked. It is likely the most probable scenario to occur is one where the lead time is somewhere in between very short and very long. There is a plethora of different techniques in the literature, but some are so fanciful that their reliability would certainly be in question. There is a need for a new deflection technique that has the reliability and the precision of the gravity tractor but is able to produce larger deflection forces to handle much shorter lead times. This is the problem that this paper addresses. The proposed solution to this problem is a push-pull asteroid magnetic tractor(MT) that is shown to produce orders of magnitudes larger deflection forces and to accommodate much shorter lead times than the GT.","A novel Push-Pull Asteroid Magnetic Tractor(MT) "

By using geometric mechanics, the full dynamics of the dumbbell spacecraftin the gravity  eld of the asteroid is derived. Then, the orbit-attitude relative equilib-ria about asteroids 4769 Castalia, 433 Eros, and 6489 Golevka are obtained by solvingthe condition of stationary points of the Lagrangian. The orbit-attitude equilibria of thedumbbell spacecraft provide natural positions for large tethered satellite hovering over theasteroid surface.

Currently transitioning from the preliminary design review phase, the mission is directed towards the design of a small orbiter spacecraft to orbit and study the moon in a low lunar orbit (LLO). The SRMSAT ¨C 2 is unlike conventional small satellites, which are usually operated in Earth orbits and have lower power constraints because communication from these orbits would not require a high amount of power and propulsion maneuvers are low or non-existent. There is also a strict size constraint on the subsystem set by launch vehicles because small satellites are almost always launched as piggyback. Apart from limitation by way of power, physical dimensions, mass, and budget, there is also a significant challenge imposed due to the distance involved, with the mission requiring communication from a distance up to 1.5 Million Km. ISRO Deep Space Network (IDSN) is necessary to support this mission, and the support is aspired. The subsystem consists of one High Gain Antenna for payload and housekeeping data transmission; and two Low Gain Antennas for omnidirectional coverage, used for command, ranging and emergency communications.","Telemetry, Tracking & Command Subsystem of SRMSAT - 2 "

2953,AIAA-2016-5686,Fully-Coupled Dynamical Jitter Modeling of a Rigid Spacecraft with Imbalanced Reaction Wheels,"A key source of pointing jitter is due to reaction wheels (RWs) mass imbalance about the wheel spinaxis. Although these effects are often characterized through experimentation in order to validate requirements,it is of interest to include jitter in a computer simulation of the spacecraft in the early stagesof spacecraft development. An estimate of jitter amplitude may be found by modeling wheel imbalancetorques as an external disturbance on the spacecraft. In this case, reaction wheel mass imbalances arelumped into static and dynamic imbalance parameters, allowing jitter force and torque to be simplyproportional to wheel speed squared. A physically realistic dynamic model may be obtained by definingmass imbalances in terms of a RWcenter of mass location and inertia tensor. The fully-coupled dynamicmodel allows momentum and energy validation of the system. This is often critical when modeling additionalcomplex dynamical behavior such as flexible dynamics and fuel slosh. Furthermore, it is necessaryto use the fully-coupled model in instances where the relative mass properties of the spacecraft with respectto the RWs cause the simplified jitter model to be inaccurate. This paper presents a generalizedapproach to reaction wheel imbalance modeling of a rigid hub with N reaction wheels. A discussionis included to convert from manufacturer specifications on RW imbalances to the introduced parameters.In addition, a back-substitution method is introduced to increase the computational efficiency of acomputer simulation.","Fully-Coupled Dynamical Jitter Modeling of a Rigid Spacecraft"
2954,AIAA-2016-5625,Rocket Launch Noise and the Coanda Effect,"The Coanda effect is the tendency of a stream of fluid to stay attached to a convex surface, rather than follow a straight line in its original direction. Turbulent Coanda wall jets are present in a multitude of applications. The obvious advantages associated with Coanda jets compared with conventional jet flows¡ªin terms of substantial flow deflection, increased lift and enhanced levels of turbulence and entrainment¡ªare often accompanied by a considerable increase in both associated noise levels and occurrence of jet breakaway. Generally, the reasons for these issues are not well understood and thus the full potential offered by the Coanda effect is yet to be realized. It is clear that the ability to better predict Coanda jet noise would offer the opportunity for the Coanda principle to be more widely exploited and its potential to be more fully realized. In this paper, the results of recent modelling and experiments on a three-dimensional turbulent Coanda wall jet are presented. The application of these results to important problems of practical interest such as launch noise is also discussed, and recent data pertaining to full-scale rocket launch noise sources is presented. In particular, the behaviour of the jet exhaust within the flame trench of the Antares rocket is considered. Inside this trench a curved turbulent wall jet flows adjacent to a Coanda surface. A simple model is developed for predicting the flow in this trench and preliminary results related to the noise emitted by the rocket plume (flame) trench are discussed.","Rocket Launch Noise and the Coanda Effect "

The realization of hot primary structures like control surfaces requires system competence and sophisticated know-how in material processing, manufacturing and qualification of structural components and in all aspects from process control, arc jet and hot structure testing. Thermal structural challenges can be quite severe on re-entry vehicles and CMC provide high strength at elevated temperatures which are key features for hot structures. One of the primary thermal structural challenges results from large thermal gradients. Control surfaces such as flaps are often hot and are often connected to an actuator inside the vehicle which is much cooler. CIRA has recently set up a research and development project with Italian industrial partners, with the aim of working on design and development of hot structures based on CMC technology.

To learn and adapt to the operational environment, cognitive networking uses a variety of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The concept of cognitive networking is still early in its development, and there are a number of different technologies that can be combined and explored to realize different aspects of a cognitive network. Network emulation is a useful way to study cognitive technology. Existing emulation tools tend to focus more on supporting present technologies than on those of the future (e. g. software-defined networking, delay-tolerant networking, and others). This paper describes CogSWEL, an emulation technology designed to support the exploration of technologies for cognitive networking and intelligent routing. The paper begins with an exploration of the unique aspects of cognitive networking for space communications, and explains some of the gaps in existing emulation systems. Next, the paper explains the Mininet technology that CogSWEL is based on, and reviews Mininet¡¯s strengths and weaknesses for cognitive networking, along with how CogSWEL enhances Mininet. The paper explains that, using only minimal engineering time and cost, CogSWEL has been used to model both present (SCaN Testbed) and future (SGSS) networks.

By combining the benefitsof frequency diversity, polyphase spreading code and multiuser-detection (MUD) gain together, this new platform notonly offers the capability of operating over multiple noncontiguousfrequency bands and making it suitable for overlaycognitive radio systems, it provides excellent BER performanceas well. Specifically, by decomposing the available subcarriersin a cognitive radio environment into multiple non-contiguoussubsets, the proposed scheme is able to spread data symbolsacross multiple non-contiguous subcarriers to exploit frequencydiversity. Furthermore, due to the fact that the total number ofsubcarriers within each subset is small, an optimal maximumlikelihood MUD receiver can be built at reasonable complexity.Finally, by exploiting polyphase Carrier Interferometry (CI)spreading codes, the number of subcarriers in each subset nolonger has limitation. Simulation results over various multi-pathfading channels and spectrum availability scenarios confirm theperformance gain of the proposed scheme over conventional noncontiguousOFDM and non-contiguous SOFDM systems.","Non-Contiguous Frequency Division Spread OFDM"

The Aviation industry has transformed the way of travelling across globe. Now it is more economic, comfortable and accessible to travel. Unfortunately, this revolution in aviation has brought various environmental issues; gaseous emissions and noise nuisance. These gaseous emissions disrupt the eco-system normal operating process. These gases have serious implications on the global environment and pose a great risk for human health. The NOx (NO and NO2) is a major concern; especially around the airports locality, where it can create ozone gas which is harmful to the wellbeing. In spite of much advancement in fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines, the rapid growth of air travel in recent years has contributed to an increase in total emissions. According to the ICAO, the contribution of civil aircraft to global greenhouse emissions has been estimated at around 2%. The Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), which assists ICAO in the formulation of new policies on aircraft noise and emissions, has presented a number of policies in the last decade in order to curb down the aviation emissions. Due to these emission regulations, the aviation industry is looking into the ways to cut down its global emission imprints.The primary objective of this paper is to assess the suitability of the stirred reactor modelling approach to predict NOx emissions of a Rich-Burn Quick-Quench Lean-Burn (RQL) combustor concept. This paper further illustrates the axial variation in the main parameters such as equivalence ratio, NOx mass fractions and temperature for a NASA test rig experiment combustor geometry from the RQL combustor model based on the stirred reactor method.

To that end, this paper establishes a set of characterization parameters based on the temperaturedistribution and flows conditions at the nozzle exit. Hot streak phenomena observed for a set of serpentineexhaust nozzles are compared using a modified White number that accounts for arbitrary cross-sectional areaand streamline curvature changes in a nozzle. Using these parameters, quantifiable differences are observedin the size, intensity, and location of hot flow at the nozzle exits.

Inthis context, employing full frequency reuse and precoding over multiple beams has showngreat throughput potential in literature. In addition, even with having full frequency reusepattern, unpredictable changes in the traffic demands might cause the launch of comple-mentary satellites that support exciting ones adding extra capacity in satellite rush points.To this end, the topic of coordinated multibeam satellite systems, in which satellites sharespatial (i.e. same coverage area) and spectral (i.e. full frequency reuse among beams andsatellites) degrees of freedom, has been taken into account. However, one of major obsta-cle to develop coordinated multibeam satellite applications is intensive level of inter-beamand inter-satellite interference at the user terminals which are jointly serving through satel-lites. To cope with this problem, the present contribution proposes a cooperated precodingscheme to manage both interference and enhance the performance of the whole system,while maintaining low system complexity. Since the precoding is sensitive to Channel StateInformation (CSI) quality at the transmitting segment, cooperated terms refers to the ap-proach that a proper CSI exchange mechanism is implemented among satellite subsystemsso that each subsystem performs a part of whole precoding scheme. In this context, wepropose a novel Coordinated Block Zero Forcing (CBZF) precoder combined with a sched-uler whose role is to select a set of high quality on-board feeds at each satellite towards userterminals and handles CSI exchange mechanism among satellite subsystems. In addition,we develop the proposed CBZF with considering both classical total and also individual on-board feed power constraints in order to efficient and more realistic use of payload powerresources.

Using a validated 2d transient, double precision, density-based implicit, Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation, RANS Spalart-Allmaras model, parametric analytical studies have been carried out to examine the external flow features of aircraft flying in close proximity to the ground. We incorporated a new validated code, into our analysis to exact the motion of the airfoil in the computational domain. Through our numerical case studies we discerned that Boeing 737 root airfoil moving at a velocity of 200 m/s with zero angle of attack at a ground-height-to-chord ratio of 0.1 produced external flow choking. We inferred that, at identical wing-in-ground effect conditions, the stationary airfoil exhibited early external flow choking than moving airfoil due to the relatively large area fraction blocked by the boundary layer displacement thickness. In all the simulations it has been observed that the boundarylayer blockage is low in the case of a moving airfoil than that in the case of a stationary airfoil -possibly due to the slip boundary condition at the surface of the moving airfoil. We observed a new phenomena of bubble formation inside the boundarylayer and its subsequent transition into vortices under the moving wing. On contemplating the flow features of stationary and moving wings we comprehended that the moving wing in ground effect simulation produces excellent results in par with the flight test data. A comparison of the analyses of stationary and moving airfoils stipulated to opt for a moving airfoil simulation for an accurate prediction of any flying craft in ground effect. We concluded that, in lieu of the conventional fixed wing flow analyses for ground effect studies, it is invariably beneficial to go for a pragmatic analysis of all the moving craft in ground effect, which is analogous and would have the aspects of a real-time parametric flow. This study is a pointer to the pilots for perceiving the zone of danger at moving wing in ground effect.","Studies on Boundarylayer Blockage and  "

In order for the next generation wireless to provide seamless access, whether the user is indoors or out, a thorough understanding and validation of models describing the impact of building entry loss (BEL) is required. Thisinformation is currently lacking and presents a challenge for most system designers. For this reason empirical data is needed to assess the impact of BEL at frequencies that are being explored for future mobile broadband Applications.This paper present the results of measurements of outdoor-to-indoor propagation from 5-32 GHz in three different buildings. The first is a newer building that is similar in construction to modern residential home. The second is an older commercial office building. The last building is a very new commercial office building built using modern ¡°green¡± building techniques. These three buildings allow for the measurement of propagation losses through both modern and older materials; such as glass/windows and exterior block and siding. Initial results found that at particular spatial locations the BEL could be less than 1dB or more than 70dB with free space losses discounted (this is likely influenced by multipath). Additionally, it was observed that the PDF distributions of a majority of the measurements trended toward log-normal with means and standard deviations ranging from 8-38dB and 6-14dB, respectively.","Results of Outdoor to Indoor Propagation "

The amount of force required to fullycompress the test article in the sealing interface and the force needed to separate the jointwere also measured. The outgassing and resistance measurements were below the maximumallowable levels. The room temperature compression set and leak rates were fairly highwhen compared against other typical spacecraft seal materials, but were not excessive.

The simulation accurately predicts the shape of the stressedmeniscus up to the point of instability. By analyzing the simulation results it is possible toisolate the individual contributions of electric, magnetic, and capillary stress. Near the onsetof spray instability it is shown that the magnitude of the magnetic stress can comprise 2/3 ofthe magnitude of the electric stress suggesting that the resulting spray is strongly affected bymagnetic influence and is thus markedly different than classical electrospray.","Ferrofluid Interface Deformation and Spray Onset under "

The solutions had 3.04,5.98, 8.80, and 14.15 wt% iron-oxide nanoparticles making them susceptible to magneticfields. A Helmholtz coil was used to impose a magnetic stress onto the electrospray source.The addition of nanoparticles to neat IL increased viscosity, and decreased conductivity andsurface tension of the fluid. The emission current followed the proportionality I ~ Q? K , witha slope that depended upon both the concentration of nanoparticles and the magnetic field.The addition of nanoparticles caused an increase in the total emission current from the sourcewhen compared to neat IL running at the same flowrate. Conversely, the addition of amagnetic stress decreased the total emission current from the source compared to the fieldfreecase; the change was larger in solutions with a higher wt% of nanoparticles. The magneticstress also decreased the minimum stable flowrate that could be achieved, widening theoperational envelope beyond that of traditional non-magnetic electrospray.","The effects of magnetic surface stress on electrospray of an "

The solutions had 3.04, 5.98, and 8.80 wt% iron oxide nanoparticlesmaking them susceptible to magnetic fields. A Helmholtz coil was used to impose a gradientfreemagnetic stress onto the electrospray source. Mass spectra were collected in the sprayfrom each of the solutions, with and without the imposed magnetic field. The magnetic stresscaused an increase in the peak intensity of distinct ion species (n = 0 or n = 1) at lower energydefects suggesting that the stress causes ions to be born at higher energy. The ratio of the ionpeak intensity with magnetic field to ion peak intensity at zero magnetic field was proportionalto the concentration of nanoparticles. The magnetic stress did not significantly affect the largemass distributions until the nanoparticle concentration reached 8.80 wt% in the fluid.","Species measurements in the beam of an ionic liquid "
2975,AIAA-2016-4627,Numerical simulations and comparison with measurements,"We present a model that quantifies the magnitude of the ion-acoustic turbulence (IAT) in the plume of hollow cathodes and its effect on the resistivity and ion heating. The model takes the form of a partial differential equation (PDE) that can be solved concurrently with the equations of motion for a partially ionized plasma already included in our numerical code for the simulation of the plasma discharge in hollow cathodes, OrCa2D. We also determine that self-induced magnetic fields are not negligible in hollow cathodes operating at large discharge currents and implement in our code Ampere¡¯s law and modifications to Ohm¡¯s law that account for this effect. Numerical simulations that employed these models show large improvements in our agreement with experimental measurements with respect to a previous model, which assumed complete saturation of the IAT and did not account for the growth stage of the waves. In particular, the model is able to accurately predict the location and magnitude of the maximum resitivity to the electron current along the cathode centerline.","First-principles Modeling of IAT-driven Anomalous "
2976,AIAA-2016-4628,Numerical and Experimental Study on Discharge Characteristics of High-Current Hollow Cathode,"A laboratory model of a hollow cathode with a radiative heater was built and tested for discharge currents of 10-50 A. Plasma ignitions and also discharge operations were successfully demonstrated even if the heater was not wrapped with an insulator, which will lead to robustness against heater breakdown. The voltage-current characteristic indicates that mode transition occurred between 30 and 40 A for a mass flow rate of 30 sccm. To investigate the flow field, a Hybrid-PIC simulation was conducted for a mass flow rate of 30 sccm and a discharge current of 30 A. The result shows acceptable distributions of the electron density, electric potential, and electron temperature inside and outside the cathode. The keeper¡¯s floating voltage was close to the experimental data, but was slightly higher than experimental data. Changing the parameters of the anomalous resistivity can adjust the keeper¡¯s floating voltage, but it has strong impact on the plasma properties.","Numerical and Experimental Study on Discharge "

2978,AIAA-2016-4530,Overview of Vortex Injected Hybrid Rocket Engines-Regression Rate Modeling,"Poor regression rates generally observed in Hybrid Rocket Engines (HRE) tend to undermine the benefits in safety and storability over Solid Rocket Motors (SRM). These poor regression rates often necessitate the use of complex, multi-port fuel grains which reduce the overall volumetric efficiency of the propulsion system. The Vortex Injected Hybrid Rocket Engine concept has been shown to significantly increase the fuel regression rate in a simple single-port fuel grain. In this engine configuration, liquid oxidizer is injected tangentially to the aft end of the fuel grain and generates a bi-directional vortex flow field within the engine. This highly turbulent flow increases the rate of heat transfer to the fuel grain surface, resulting in an increased regression rate. In order to determine the potential effects of scaling this concept up from laboratory scale, it is imperative to develop an accurate internal ballistics model. A survey of previously developed regression rate models for this, and other engine configurations employing swirling flows has been conducted to highlight the design and operation parameters which yield the largest effect on the fuel regression rate.","Overview of Vortex Injected Hybrid Rocket Engines-"

The engine uses NitrousOxide and an oxidized fuel grain with an aft end vortex injection scheme. The engine wassized to produce 8000ft/s of Delta V for the vehicle and has an average thrust of 375 lbf with apredicted burn time of 22 seconds. Engine weight was reduced through the use of additivemanufacturing technology. A subscale proof of concept test was conducted to demonstratethe injection concept and ignition feasibility for the fuel/oxidizer combination. The subscaletest performed as expected producing 12 lbf of thrust with a chamber pressure of 252 psi. Theplastic injector manifold survived the testing, however the aft end vortex gaseous injectionwas not able to adequately cool the printed parts resulting in some melting of the hardware.","Development of a Vortex Hybrid Upper Stage Engine "

Part of the technology maturation effort includedexperimental evaluation of the TDU-1 thruster with conducting and dielectric front pole covermaterials in two different electrical configurations. A graphite front magnetic pole coverthruster configuration with the thruster body electrically tied to cathode, and an alumina frontpole cover thruster configuration with the thruster body floating were evaluated. Bothconfigurations were also evaluated at different facility background pressure conditions toevaluate background pressure effects on thruster operation. Performance characterizationtests found that higher thruster performance was attained with the graphite front pole coverconfiguration with the thruster electrically tied to cathode. A total thrust efficiency of 68%and a total specific impulse of 2,820 s was demonstrated at a discharge voltage of 600 V and adischarge power of 12.5 kW. Thruster stability regimes were characterized with respect to thethruster discharge current oscillations and with maps of the discharge current-voltagemagneticfield (IVB). Analysis of TDU-1 discharge current waveforms found that lowernormalized discharge current peak-to-peak and root mean square magnitudes were attainedwhen the thruster was electrically floated with alumina front pole covers. Backgroundpressure effects characterization tests indicated that the thruster performance and stabilitywere mostly invariant to changes in the facility background pressure for vacuum chamberpressure below 1¡Á10-5 Torr-Xe (for thruster flow rates of 20.5 mg/s). Power spectral density analysis of the discharge current waveforms showed that increasing the vacuum chamberbackground pressure resulted in a higher discharge current dominant breathing modefrequency. Finally, IVB maps of the TDU-1 thruster indicated that the discharge currentbecame more oscillatory with higher discharge current peak-to-peak and RMS values withincreased facility background pressure at lower thruster mass flow rates; thruster operationat higher flow rates resulted in less change to the thruster¡¯s IVB characteristics with elevatedbackground pressure.","Characterization Tests of NASA¡¯s Hall Effect Rocket with "

Prior to the environmental test campaign, the performance and behavior of the second HERMeS unit was characterized at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The data collected for the two HERMeS units were compared to identify changes in performance related to both the geometric differences between the thrusters and the differences in facility effects imparted by the two vacuum chambers. Thrust, specific impulse, efficiency, and discharge current oscillations were compared between the two HERMeS units. The performance was similar between the two thrusters, with a maximum difference of 3.5% of the measurements and the majority falling within the uncertainty of the measurements.

However, they have recently gained popularity due to their increasing scienceand engineering return (e.g. lab on a chip technology and small but capable telecommu-nications packages). This has in turn lead to the desire to make them more controllableand brought the need for small propulsion systems to the forefront. Current research isfocused on providing a propulsion system capable of providing enough impulse to allowa CubeSat/SmallSat to preform a stand-alone interplanetary mission. Small propulsionsystems capable of delivering su cient  V for orbit insertion do not yet exist. However,there is signi cant interest in developing such systems as they have the potential to enablea new class of low cost stand-alone interplanetary missions.This paper presents propulsion system trades for dedicated propulsion stages with atotal spacecraft and stage wet mass ranging from 25 kg to 100 kg. The propulsion systemis designed such that it and the spacecraft can be accomodated as a secondary payloadon an ESPA ring. Propulsion systems using a hybrid rocket motor as the main engineare compared to Liquid MonoPropellant (LMP) systems. The hybrid propulsion systemis found to out-perform the LMP system, and is typically able to deliver an extra 6 % ofpayload mass.The promising performance of the hybrid propulsion system precipitated a more detailedexamination of the utility of these systems for ight. An Attitude Control System (ACS)analysis was conducted to investigate the feasibility of controlling the spacecraft. It wasfound that the spacecraft should theoretically be controllable.

This additional benefit of low temperature storage and operationcould substantially reduce the power required to maintain the system while on Mars andtherefore decrease the total landed system mass required for the system. A new wax-basedhybrid fuel has been formulated to realize these low temperature benefits, while stillpreserving high performance (Isp). The freezing point of the oxidizer can be selected tomatch the capabilities of the fuel, in this case Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen has been selected.The main disadvantages of this system are associated with the relatively low technologyreadiness level of the selected hybrid propulsion system for operation on Mars. However,technology development efforts are currently underway to advance the hybrid propulsionsystem to a level where it could potentially compete with heritage propulsion systems.

Mode transition from the low-speed propulsion system to the high-speed propulsion system is one of the most critical TBCC enabling technologies. In this paper, the airbreathing high Mach propulsion system simulation tool (HiMach) was developed for the steady-state and transient performance analysis of all modes of operation, including mode transition, for a TBCC engine. A simplified model of turbojet windmilling was incorporated to consider the shutdown process of the turbojet during mode transition. Performance analysis of mode transition for a small-scale tandem TBCC engine was conducted using HiMach. Firstly, the mode transition strategy was made based on the principle of smooth variation of thrust and total air mass flow. Secondly, the transient performance of mode transition was simulated, with the conclusion that there exists a rapid change for some key parameters during mode transition, especially when the turbojet switches to the windmilling operation mode.","Analysis of Mode Transition Performance for a Tandem "

Such novel ICFC+ improves the performance by reducing the expansion regions, which is realized by controlling the characteristic lines of local airflow. Based on six different chosen functions of compression behaviors, the line-function is the best way to remarkably improve the performance of flow pattern with nearly uniform flow after the reflected shock. Then a single-degree-of-freedom configuration of variable-geometry IWI has been proposed in this paper, the simulation results of the design Mach number (M4) indicates that the osculating axisymmetric theory concept of IWI can be adopted to design 3D, complicated shape to capture almost all the air flow. Furthermore, at lower Mach numbers, variable-geometry IWI still can capture nearly all of mass flow with ? = 0.98; none of other inlets have been reported globally with such rather high-performance characteristic of mass flow capture at lower Mach numbers. Moreover, the main flow structures nearly remain the same to those at M4.0, especially at M3.5 and M3.0; while at M2.5 and M2.3, the conical shock changes obviously due to insufficiently sidewall compression.","Analyzing the parent flowfield of inward turning inlet "

In this paper an attempt has been made for the geometry optimization of a rocket engine with four truncated aerospike nozzles for an efficient thrust vectoring at various altitudes without any secondary jets. The numerical simulations have been carried out with the help of a validated three-dimensional unsteady-density based implicit shear-stress transport (SST) k¨C¦Ø model. The unstructured tetrahedron mesh with suitable stretching function has been selected in all the simulations. For simulating the performance of aerospike nozzles at different altitudes the ambient pressure is prescribed at each time step. Thrust vectoring has been achieved by altering the mass flow rate through each spike nozzle. Parametric analytical studies reveal that the aerospike nozzle with 42.99 % truncation from the spike tip produces better performance at lower altitudes. We have concluded that the judicious optimization of aerospike nozzles can facilitate better altitude compensation throughout the flight with desirable vectoring for a precise mission with commendable improvement in payload capability for single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicles.","Performance Evaluation of Aerospike Nozzles for  "

Multiple test elements were evaluated using different internaldiameters, line lengths, and flow control valves, at both atmospheric and sub-atmosphericpressure levels. Based upon experimental results, it was determined that the internaldiameter, line length, valve flow coefficient, and valve opening response time all contributedto the pressure magnitude of the priming event. It was observed that water hammerpressure levels may be minimized and equally distributed throughout a propulsion systemmanifold using a ring layout, independent of line geometry, valve flow coefficient, and valveopening response time.","Effects of Water Hammer on Propulsion Systems "

Such a technology could benefit liquid rocket engine (LRE) turbopumps required to perform deep throttle operations such as those envisioned for ascent/descent operations. In this test effort 5 LSVD concepts are designed, manufactured, and tested in a water test loop at Barber-Nichols Inc. along with a CVD configuration to provide baseline comparison data. The LSVDs were successful in offering a consistent static pressure recovery over a flow coefficient range analogous to deep throttle operation in a turbopump and achieved a level of increased pump head coefficient higher than the CVD diffuser at flow coefficients below 0.09. Shaping the leading edge of the second LSVD concept based on predictions from a modified potential flow free-streamline analysis produces higher pump head coefficients over the LSVD concept with a full radius leading edge. The test results suggest that the LSVD design guidelines for low speed compressors may be successfully applied to pumps, and further that the adaptation and modification of an existing free-streamline analysis methodology to guide the contouring of diffuser vane leading edges was successful.","The Design and Analysis of Low Solidity Vaned Diffusers "

To meet the requirements offuture multi-satellite missions, closed-form solutions of the inverse relative dynamics aresought in arbitrary orbits. Time constraints dictated by mission operations and relevantperturbations acting on the formation are taken into account by splitting the optimal recon- guration in a guidance (long-term) and control (short-term) layer. Both problems are castin relative orbit element space which allows the simple inclusion of secular and long-periodicperturbations through a state transition matrix and the translation of the fuel-optimaloptimization into a minimum-length path-planning problem. Due to the proper choiceof state variables, both guidance and control problems can be solved (semi-)analyticallyleading to optimal, predictable maneuvering schemes for simple on-board implementation.Besides generalizing previous work, this paper  nds four new in-plane and out-of-plane(semi-)analytical solutions to the optimal control problem in the cases of unperturbed ec-centric and perturbed near-circular orbits. A general delta-v lower bound is formulatedwhich provides insight into the optimality of the control solutions, and a strong analogybetween elliptic Hohmann transfers and formation-ying control is established. Finally,the functionality, performance, and bene ts of the new impulsive maneuvering schemesare rigorously assessed through numerical integration of the equations of motion and asystematic comparison with primer vector optimal control.","New Closed-Form Solutions for Optimal Impulsive"

3014,AIAA-2016-5395,Quantification of the Responsiveness of On-Orbit Servicing Infrastructure for Modularized Earth-Orbiting Platforms,"This paper aims to quantify the responsiveness of two on-orbit servicing infrastructures providing services to multiple serviceable platforms in medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary orbit (GEO). The platforms to be serviced are assumed to be made of elementary units (EUs). EUs are small standardized structural units capable of aggregating with each other and gathering the key functions of a typical satellite within the size of a 6U cubesat. The first servicing infrastructure considered in this paper, called ¡°Without Depot¡± (WoD), includes a launch vehicle and a robotic servicer. The second servicing infrastructure, called ¡°With Depot¡± (WD) includes a launch vehicle, a robotic servicer and an orbital depot of EUs. The responsiveness of these infrastructures is quantified using a queueing theory-based stochastic simulation in Simulink taking into account the launch and platform random failures. The metrics used to quantify the responsiveness are the service completion rate and the average waiting time before a failed EU on the client platform is replaced over a 10-year period of operation. With respect to those metrics, it is demonstrated that WD is more responsive than WoD. However, WD is also shown to be likely to cost more than WoD. Finally, the sensitivity of the responsiveness of WD to the capacity of the orbital depot is analyzed to find the capacity level of the orbital depot, beyond which the responsiveness of WD is not significantly improved. This last result could be of interest for space designers dealing with the sizing of on-orbit servicing infrastructures. We believe that the project introduced in this paper will be a critical milestone in the design of a responsive integrated space infrastructure dedicated to the development and prosperity of a new GEO/MEO economy.","Quantification of the Responsiveness of On-Orbit Servicing "

Reflectivity control system is the one and only fuel-freeattitude control system already demonstrated on orbit. The spacecraft system has, however, acritical issue that it is not trivial at all to estimate the attitude maneuverability. The dynamicsof the spacecraft is highly affected by various uncertain factors such as the sail deformationand the optical property distribution of the sail surface. In order to address the issue, thispaper introduces a methodology of estimating the maneuverability with incorporating theeffect by such uncertainty. The present paper first derives an analytical formulation of themaneuverability. The formulation reveals a remarkable fact that only two representativeparameters govern the maneuverability.

Recent announcements of commercial small satellite constellations indicate interestin deploying hundreds to thousands of micro-satellites into Low-Earth Orbit at altitudesranging from 1,000-1,200 km, in order to provide global internet service. These constel-lations create a great need for a standard system for deorbit to help mitigate the orbitaldebris problem. This paper describes a deployable drag device that leverages recent ad-vancements in thin membrane deployable structures to create a passive aerodynamicallystable drag sail that will ensure a satellite deorbits within 25 years regardless of its func-tionality. The aerodynamic stability of the drag device is evaluated for orbit altitudesranging from 400 to 600 km, while varying the apex half-angle of the square pyramid dragsail from 65 to 85 deg. An apex half-angle of 80 or 85 deg provides passive stability formost conditions at orbit altitudes of 500 km and lower.

3019,AIAA-2016-5330,Estimation of In-orbit Magnetometer Measurement Bias,"Three-axis magnetometer is commonly used for attitude determination of small satellites with other sensors due to its features of low power consumption, light weight and few environmental restrictions. Its measurement bias reduces the accuracy of attitude control. The geomagnetic field and solar activity may impact the satellite remanence and the performance of the magnetometer, thus cause bias of the magnetometer measurement. However, it is hard to test the magnetometer directly in orbit, so we need to find new methods to estimate the bias for calibration and further design. Based on the flight data of Smart Communication Satellite (SCS) over the past year, two new methods are proposed in this paper to determine the bias, using Kalman filter for real-time estimation and long-time tracking. In this paper, the proposed methods are discussed and applied to SCS to evaluate their performances. In addition to high accuracy and fast convergence, the proposed approaches are suitable for most small satellites.","Estimation of In-orbit Magnetometer Measurement Bias "

3043,AIAA-2016-4922,Characterization of thermoplastic-elastomeric seals at high pressures and temperatures,The article focuses on characterization of leak rates under high pressure and temperature in thermoplastic barrier seals used in gas lift valves and other applications. The objective of the study is to validate the O-ring seal design and material under high pressure and temperature and also to check if it would meet the stringent leakage requirements laid out in the Statoil standards. Finite element analysis (FEA) on the seal design at 400 ?F and under 10000 psi aided the selection of appropriate seal material.

3044,AIAA-2016-5012,Fission Surface Power Technology Demonstration Test Results,"The Fission Surface Power (FSP) Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) is a system-level demonstration of fission power technology intended for use on manned missions to Mars. The Baseline FSP systems consists of a 190 kWt UO2 fast-spectrum reactor cooled by a primary pumped liquid metal loop. This liquid metal loop transfers heat to two intermediate liquid metal loops designed to isolate fission products in the primary loop from the balance of plant. The intermediate liquid metal loops transfer heat to four Stirling Power Conversion Units (PCU), each of which produce 12 kWe (48 kW total) and reject waste heat to two pumped water loops, which transfer the waste heat to titanium-water heat pipe radiators. The FSP TDU simulates a single leg of the baseline FSP system using an electrically heater core simulator, a single liquid metal loop, a single PCU, and a pumped water loop which rejects the waste heat to a Facility Cooling System (FCS). When operated at the nominal operating conditions (modified for low liquid metal flow) during TDU testing the PCU produced 8.9 kW of power at an efficiency of 21.7% resulting in a net system power of 8.1 kW and a system level efficiency of 17.2%. The reduction in PCU power from levels seen during electrically heated testing is the result of insufficient heat transfer from the NaK heater head to the Stirling acceptor, which could not be tested at Sunpower prior to delivery to GRC. The maximum PCU power of 10.4 kW was achieved at the maximum liquid metal temperature of 875 K, minimum water temperature of 350 K, 1.1 kg/s liquid metal flow, 0.39 kg/s water flow, and 15.0 mm amplitude at an efficiency of 23.3%. This resulted in a system net power of 9.7 kW and a system efficiency of 18.7 %.","Fission Surface Power Technology Demonstration Unit Test "
3045,AIAA-2016-5013,Two-Step Multi-Physics Analysis of an Annular Linear Induction Pump for Fission Power Systems,"One of the key technologies associated with fission power systems (FPS) is the annular linear induction pump (ALIP). ALIPs are used to circulate liquid-metal fluid for transporting thermal energy from the nuclear reactor to the power conversion device. ALIPs designed and built to date for FPS project applications have not performed up to expectations. A unique, two-step approach was taken toward the multi-physics examination of an ALIP using ANSYS Maxwell 3D and Fluent. This multi-physics approach was developed so that engineers could investigate design variations that might improve pump performance. Of interest was to determine if simple geometric modifications could be made to the ALIP components with the goal of increasing the Lorentz forces acting on the liquid-metal fluid, which in turn would increase pumping capacity. The multi-physics model first calculates the Lorentz forces acting on the liquid metal fluid in the ALIP annulus. These forces are then used in a computational fluid dynamics simulation as (a) internal boundary conditions and (b) source functions in the momentum equations within the Navier-Stokes equations. The end result of the two-step analysis is a predicted pump pressure rise that can be compared with experimental data.","Two-Step Multi-Physics Analysis of an Annular Linear "

3047,AIAA-2016-4842,Plasma Erosion of Stressed Fused Silica and M26 Borosil,"The life of Hall effect thrusters (HETs) is limited by the erosion of the discharge channel wall. Erosion during long duration life testing of HETs produces surface features that are unexplained by present models. Anomalous erosion ridges are one such unexplained feature. An experiment is designed to test whether the evolution of surface features created by plasma-erosion is influenced by mechanical stress in the eroded material. Three pairs of fused silica samples and two pairs of M26 borosil are exposed to argon plasma at a vacuum facility operating pressure of 1.355¡Á10-2 Pa. Ion current densities are ~3 mA/cm2. A spring-loaded clamp compresses one sample of the pair to stresses ranging from 6 to 25 MPa. Equilibrium temperatures on the samples are modeled to be as high as 500 ?C. Test fixture temperatures range from 225 to 288 ?C during exposure. Detailed surface statistics are collected before and after each exposure with a Tencor P-15 contact profilometer. Optical and laser microscopy is conducted at set locations on the surface of each sample before and after exposure with an Olympus LEXT microscope. The results show that a 100-¦Ìm pattern of parabolic depressions bounded by cusps develops on the fused silica samples. This cell pattern develops only in the presence of, and from, initial surface roughness (1.90¡À0.54 ¦Ìm). The cell pattern can be explained as the result of the angle dependence of the sputtering yield of fused silica. The development of the final roughness pattern of the borosil samples is insensitive to initial surface roughness. The surface pattern on the borosil samples develops as a result of the heterogeneous microstructure of the material, and the difference in sputtering rate between BN grains and the silica matrix. No differences between the evolution of the stressed and control sample surfaces for loads of up to 24.99¡À1.10 MPa (silica) and 24.1¡À3.4 MPa (borosil) are detected after a 12-hr exposure.","Plasma Erosion of Stressed Fused Silica and M26 Borosil "

The dependence of thespatial distribution of boron on the velocity distribution functions (VDFs) used to ini-tialize boron macroparticles is investigated. Assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann distributionfor the forward and transverse sputtering directions, the bulk velocity and temperatureof the sputtered atoms are varied, and the resulting boron density pro les are analyzedand compared to experimental measurements. The bulk velocity of the sputtered atomslargely controls the amount of boron that escapes into the thruster plume, with larger bulkvelocities resulting in a greater boron density, whereas the temperature of the sputteredatoms determines how boron is distributed radially in the plume. At a higher temperature,the qualitative radial distribution of boron predicted by the numerical model more closelyresembled that of experimental measurements taken using cavity ring-down spectroscopy.Ultimately, both the bulk velocity and the temperature of the sputtered atoms have a sig-ni cant e ect on the distribution of boron atoms in the thruster plume, so the dependenceof both of these parameters on incident ion properties must be considered in future studies.","A Parametric Computational Study of Boron"

Those are Anode-Layer-type (TAL-type), Magnetic-Layer-type (SPT-type) and Cylindrical-type (CHT-type) Hall thrusters. The high-power TAL and SPT types have been studied for future In-space missions like manned Mars exploration. On the other hand, the low-power CHT-type will be mounted on the 3rd OIT PROITERES nano-satellite for powered flight to lunar orbit from low earth orbit. In order to achieve all missions, we are designing special structures of Hall thruster system with high performance and long lifetime.

3054,AIAA-2016-5028,Ion Acoustic Turbulence and Ion Energy Measurements in the Plume of the HERMeS Thruster Hollow Cathode,"Hollow cathodes serve as the electron source in ion and Hall thrusters. One of the lifelimiting factors of the propulsion system is cathode failure due to erosion from high energyion bombardment. Despite the successful application of hollow cathodes on commercialand deep-space missions, the fundamental physical processes of erosion are not fully un-derstood, particularly the source of the high energy ions. A recent experimental study ofthe near-plume in a high current hollow cathode con rmed the existence of ion acoustic tur-bulence (IAT), a phenomenon that was only previously suspected and modeled in numericalsimulations. Theoretical analyses and turbulence measurements in the plume establishedthat ion acceleration due to turbulence could explain the existence of high energy ions.This paper is a continuation of this work, focusing on detecting and quantifying instabili-ties in the cathode near-plume under conditions relevant for the thruster being developedfor the proposed Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission (ARRM). Ion acoustic turbulence andion energy measurements were taken at the nominal discharge currents and cathode owrates expected for ARRM, as well as o -nominal conditions to determine where it mightbe susceptible to erosion by high energy ions. Dual ion saturation probes were used tomeasure uctuations in ion saturation current and assess the wave dispersion relation. Aretarding potential energy analyzer was used to measure ion energy distribution functionsfor ions with velocities perpendicular to the plume ow. The e ect of cathode ori ce size onthe onset of IAT has also been studied. Peaks in wave amplitude were found at extremelylow ow rates and high discharge currents, where instabilities other than IAT dominate.In addition, the onset of IAT was found to occur at discharge currents as low as 35 A.Measurements also con rm that at high discharge currents above 30 A, a larger ori ce sizereduces the magnitude of turbulence. However, larger ori ces are more susceptible to lowfrequency instabilities at ow rates below 10 sccm.","Measurements in the Plume of the HERMeS Thruster"
3055,AIAA-2016-5043,Linear Actuated Micro-Cathode Arc Thruster System,"CubeSats are considered the satellites of the future because they are small, low cost, and easy to build. Due to these features, many universities and private companies utilize them for research purposes and performing experiments in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO). Although this technology has many benefits, it has been held back by its lack of propulsion, and therefore the inability to maneuver itself. Micro electric propulsion systems are an excellent candidate for remedying this. The Micro-propulsion and Nanotechnology Laboratory (MpNL) of The George Washington University (GWU) has constructed a Micro-Cathode Arc Thruster (¦ÌCAT) subsystem to propel CubeSats. This system allows CubeSats to control their attitude, actuation, orbit change, de-orbiting, and movement at a maximum specific impulse of 3000 s. Improvement of the ¦ÌCAT design allows it to become a more viable option for a myriad of small satellites and increases their capabilities. A linear actuator system was designed to replenish the cathode in order to lengthen the lifetime and power of the thruster subsystem.","Linear Actuated Micro-Cathode Arc Thruster System "

The core of this thruster is the 1cm porous tungsten crown emitter that can produce 1mN of thrust at a specific impulse of 5000 to 6000s. By removing the focus electrodes from this mN-FEEP thruster, it can be accommodated in a Volume of 10x10x6 cm or 0.6U Cubesat including all power electronics, without miniaturization of the thruster itself.

TheLangtry¡¯s algebraic Production Term Modification model is used for modeling the laminarturbulenttransition. For preliminary verification of the transition model, flows of theseveral ERCOFTAC test cases and through the Zierke-Deutsch compressor cascade arecalculated. Computations of both a fully turbulent flow and a transitional flow in the VKIGenoaturbine cascade are carried out. The contours of the Mach number, the turbulencekinetic energy, the entropy function, as well as limiting streamlines are presented. Theanalysis of the numerical results demonstrates the influence of the laminar-turbulenttransition on secondary flow patterns.

Four different injector modules constructed from conventionally machined brass or additively manufactured stainless steel were tested. Configurations tested included a straight, open annulus, as well as several converging/diverging annular nozzles.Stable operation and performance measurements were achieved with all four injectors. Over 200 hot firings were performed using GHKN¡¯s modular CDRE. Specific impulse was measured for three fuel-oxidizer combinations (methane/GOX, ethane/GOX, and ethylene/GOX) all exhausting to sea-level back pressure at Aerojet Rocketdyne¡¯s Redmond, Wash., facility using a calibrated thrust stand and mass flow meters. Stable continuous detonation was achieved with all three fuels over a wide range of equivalence ratios and flow rates. Isp values as high as 192 lbf-sec/lbm were recorded for methane/GOX. Vacuum performance was projected to be approximately 20 percent higher. Measured performance of this laboratory thruster for all three fuels generally ranged between 80-90 percent of ideal Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) liquid rocket engine estimates for sea-level performance. Comparisons with ideal CEA performance estimates were based on annulus pressures made by capillary tube averaged pressure (CTAP) sensors incorporated into the test engine.","Experimental Investigation of Continuous Detonation "

Therefore,a chemical reaction mechanism for oxygen/methane combustion was implemented intoDLR¡¯s flow solver TAU. Ignition delay simulations were conducted to demonstrate thevalidity of the implementation. The implemented baseline chemistry model was appliedfor generic nozzle flow simulations and the results were compared to frozen nozzle flowand nozzle flow in chemical equilibrium, in order to investigate the impact of the finiterateapproach.

In this application the effectiveness of the film cooling was examined under several conditions. The wall temperatures applied to the surface of the nozzle were varied from 540°R to 1500°R. This study builds on previous work by examining how adding the chemical reactions to the flow field affected the heat flux and scalar results experienced in the nozzle. For each case the heat flux experienced by the nozzle wall is presented. It was found that by applying chemical reactions to the simulations the heat flux experienced by the nozzle wall differed by 10% to 20+% from the non-reacting models depending on the wall temperature conditions and flowrate of the film cooling gas (H2), but the heat flux profiles were qualitatively similar.","CFD Analysis of Film Cooling and Heat Transfer in a "
3065,AIAA-2016-4769,3D Numerical Studies on Thrust Vectoring using Shock Induced Self Impinging Secondary Jets,"Numerical studies have been carried out using a validated 3D realizable k-epsilon turbulence model with enhanced wall treatment approach for the design optimization of a thrust vector control (TVC) system using shock induced self-impinging supersonic secondary double jet. In the first phase of this study we compared the conventional single secondary jet thrust vectoring with self impinging secondary jet with different impingement angles. We have observed that the self impinging secondary jet case with jet intersection angle of zero degree has shown better thrust vectoring than other cases. In the second phase of this study we have successfully carried out and compared 6 TVC system cases with zero jet intersection angle with same inflow conditions but with different locations of secondary jet impingement. The results from the parametric studies reveal that the shock induced self-impinging supersonic secondary double jet is more efficient at a location of 0.9 times the axial length (Xd) of the divergent section from the throat of a CD nozzle of area ratio 4.7129 with a divergent angle of 9.6o than all other 15 cases considered in this study with same inflow conditions. We have estimated the thrust vectoring angle of such a system with the jet intersection angle of zero degree as 5.0172o, which is better than the other cases considered in this study for vectoring, though the average momentum thrust of the vehicle was found marginally low compared to a case with jet intersection angle of 30 degree. We comprehended that the thrust vectoring performance increases as the jet location moves away from the throat but not very close to the nozzle exit. We conjectured that the flexible steering is possible after invoking ON/OFF control facility to the secondary nozzles for meeting the onboard mission requirements. We concluded that the supersonic self-impinging secondary double jet at zero degree jet intersection angle and predesigned location can provide higher thrust vectoring efficiency than conventional supersonic single secondary jet thrust-vector control system without compromising the payload capability of any type of rockets.","3D Numerical Studies on Thrust Vectoring using Shock "
3066,AIAA-2016-4919,Testing the Possibility of Weight Changes in Highly-Polarized Electrets,"To defy gravity is one of mankind¡¯s earliest dreams. Recent patents by Kita as well asothers claimed that electrically polarized materials show anomalous weight readings overtime. We decided to assess this phenomena in our own setup under controlled laboratoryconditions. An electret mixture of carnauba wax, rosin and beeswax was made and polarizedbetween two electrodes connected to a high voltage power supply. The electrostatic field wasapplied at the beginning from the liquid state to complete solidification until roomtemperature was reached. To measure the resulting electrostatic field, an electrostaticvoltmeter was used. The weight was measured with a laboratory balance. The first electretswere created inside a polycarbonate container and measured in an open environment. Theweight measurement showed a particular fluctuation and also a constant increase. A similarfluctuation could be seen in a separately executed electrostatic field measurement. Themeasurements of non-polarized electrets showed the same overall increase in weight as thepolarized electrets. The second container type was made out of glass with a lid for evenbetter sealing in addition to a sealed box to isolate the whole measurement setup. The glasscontainer further improved the weight measurement, but made the measurement of theelectrostatic field unreliable. We observed similar trends of the weight readings over timefor both polarized and non-polarized control electrets that do not confirm any polarizationinducedinfluence on weight. After implementing significant sealing procedures, our weightchanges with carnauba wax electrets in the polarized and non-polarized state were in theseveral mg range per day compared to claimed weight variations by Kita using a mixture ofcarnauba wax and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene of up to 140 mg after 21 days.

3070,AIAA-2016-5107,An Experimental Study on the Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition in Millimeter Scale Tubes,"The deflagration-to-detonation transition of ethylene-oxygen mixture was studied in thin tubes with inner diameters of 2, 4 and 8 mm. To better make the experiment comparable to the previous simulation configuration, the flames were ignited from stationary state which conforms to the precondition of closed-end ignition. Flame speeds and other parameters were measured using high speed camera. The characteristics of pre-detonation acceleration were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is concluded that, unlike the results that the numerical researches have found, there are four distinctive acceleration stages during the DDT process. In thinner tubes, flames propagate faster, while the characteristic acceleration time is shorter in larger tubes. The sound speed of the burned and unburned gas is considered to be the critical velocity, beyond which the flame may be boosted more quickly to detonation. When the saturation speed in the third acceleration stage becomes supersonic in larger tubes, the DDT distance may be shortened.","An Experimental Study on the Deflagration-to-Detonation "
3071,AIAA-2016-5108,Numerical investigation of the initiation and propagation of oblique detonation waves in a confined combustion chamber,"Different from the phenomena in a semi-infinite domain, the initiation and propagation of oblique detonation wave in a confined combustion chamber are more complicated. Two detonation initiation modes are identified in the supersonic flow, strong initiation whose detonation wave is directly triggered after the first shock wave or reflected shock waves, and mild initiation which is characterized by self-initiation at a long distance after the first shock wave or reflected shock waves in the low Mach number flows. The standing oblique detonation wave could be initiated either by the induced shock, as long as the induced shock is strong enough, or by the subsequent reflections from the wall of the combustion chamber as well. When the velocity of supersonic incoming flow is as low as Chapman-Jouguet velocity, a pulsed-oscillating detonation wave has been maintained in the chamber with the means of changing the equivalence ratio between 0.7 and 1.0 at Ma = 3.15.","Numerical Investigation of the Initiation and Propagation of "

Simple methods are presented that allowthe packing of a large number of spheres, of di erent radius, inside a polyhedric shapemodel with packing fraction larger than 80%. The mascon model is expectedly found to beextremely fast for gravity acceleration computation, even with hundreds of thousands ofmascons, and the computation is accurate enough for short term propagation at mediumand high altitudes.

The nominal plan for Dawn includedsuccessively lower science orbits, the last of which is called the Low Altitude Mapping Orbitthat also serves as the disposal orbit after the end of mission. Prior to Dawn¡¯s arrival atCeres, it was identified that Dawn would have to meet planetary protection requirements atCeres by remaining on a stable orbit for 20 years past the end of the mission. With little apriori knowledge on Ceres¡¯ interior we analyzed what gravitational perturbations influencethe long-term dynamical evolution of Dawn around Ceres and validated that thegravitational model of Ceres with the then-current best estimate of the density distributionmodel does not exceed the permissible bounds. The forward modeling of gravity fields fromvarious shape models and density distribution was deemed valid to satisfy the planetaryprotection guidelines. This analysis was further confirmed after a new shape model based onthe actual optical images was created. The gravity field as measured in the High AltitudeMapping Orbit also fits within the bounds of gravitational field studied pre-arrival at Ceresto substantiate our methodology used to satisfy the planetary protection requirement.","Forward Modeling of Ceres¡¯ Gravity Field for Planetary "
3074,AIAA-2016-4702,Random Vibration Environment Standard Deviation Variation Verification for Solid Rocket Motors,"Statistical analysis is used in the development of solid rocket random vibration envi-ronments. This type of analysis relies heavily on the standard deviation in predictingstatistical extrema. Often, however, there is a lack of data from which to accurately de-termine the standard deviation, resulting in environments developed using assumptionsabout the standard deviation. Historically, a 3 dB standard deviation assumption has beenused for launch vehicles. This assumption is based on a single broadband value drawn overnormalized standard deviation curves that are frequency dependent. This work reassessesthese assumptions for solid rocket motors using  ve programs of varied size, performance,and structural characteristics. Based on a Monte Carlo and curve  tting extrapolationtechnique, the limit of the mean programmatic standard deviation suggests the historical3 dB assumption could be reduced nearly 50% to 1.56 dB.","Random Vibration Environment Standard Deviation"
3075,AIAA-2016-5368,Improving the Collective Precision Orbit Determination of Constellation Satellites Using Ancillary Intersatellite Ranging Data,"The capabilities of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based precision orbit determination alone may not be enough to support the needs of some satellite missions requiring precise relative or absolute positioning. It would then be necessary to augment the observations generated by an on-board GNSS receiver with additional observations of the spacecraft in order to improve the satellite state estimation. These observations could be in the form of ground-based laser ranging, or through satellite-based observations of additional ground station radio beacons. Another method, for a satellite constellation or formation, would be to add additional low-low instesatellite range observations. These could be created using a variety of methods, including existing on-board radio systems. This paper discusses the setup of a simulation environment in support of the upcoming Ranging and Nanosatelllite Guidance Experiment (RANGE) CubeSat mission. For this mission, observations of the intersatellite range will be made using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) dedicated laser ranging system. The simulation methodology outlined here will allow for estimation of the gains to precision orbit determination that should be achievable in this mission. This procedure can be generalized to other hardware and intersatellite ranging methodologies.","The Augmentation of Precision Orbit Determination "
3076,AIAA-2016-5369,On Directional Measurement Representation in Orbit Determination,"Precision Orbit Determination (OD) is often critical for successful satellite operationssupporting a wide variety of missions. Directional or angles only measurements of a satel-lite are typically represented in spherical coordinates on the observer's celestial sphere(e.g. azimuth and elevation or right ascension and declination). Computing residuals inthese angular coordinates during the OD process can introduce errors in the same way anequirectangular projection distorts both distance and direction on a map. One techniqueis to weight the azimuth residuals by the cosine of the elevation, as in a sinusoidal projec-tion. While this technique preserves the length of every parallel it still induces distortionin direction and distance. Therefore, it is proposed to use the angular distance betweenthe computed and observed locations as the residual. This is similar to using an azimuthalequidistant projection with the observed location at the center. It is shown that this tech-nique removes distortion present in the other two representations. The three techniquesare then compared experimentally for a geostationary and a low Earth orbit satellite usingsimulated data to evaluate their di erences. It is shown that using angular distance asthe residual decreases the number iterations required for convergence and allows the ODprocess to more closely  t the observed data when there are observations near the pole ofthe spherical coordinate representation.","On Directional Measurement Representation in Orbit"

A concern about particle clouds,however, is their inability to provide the analyst with closed form expressions for manystandard information theoretic quantities such as entropy and divergence. Recent ad-vances in information theory have provided techniques that can approximately estimatesuch quantities. One approach in the literature is the use of the k-th nearest neighbor(k-NN) algorithm to estimate the probability density function of the particle cloud. Giventhis density estimate, one can then compute various information theoretic quantities. Inthis paper, we review the k-NN algorithm and then discuss two applications. The firstapplication is the estimation of the entropy of a particle cloud. Specifically, we show thatthe entropy of a nonlinear Hamiltonian system is conserved if canonical coordinates areused as a coordinate frame. The second application is to estimate the divergence betweentwo particle clouds.

Measurements of the ionospheric electron density andtemperature along the ISS orbit and variations in the ISS oating potential are obtainedfrom the Floating Potential Measurement Unit (FPMU). In particular, rapid variations inISS oating potential during solar array operations on time scales of tens of millisecondscan be recorded due to the 128 Hz sample rate of the Floating Potential Probe (FPP) pro-viding interesting insight into high voltage solar array interaction with the space plasmaenvironment. Comparing the FPMU data with the ISS operations timeline and solar arraydata provides a means for correlating some of the more complex and interesting transientoating potential variations with mission operations. These complex variations are notreproduced by current models and require further study to understand the underlyingphysical processes.

Results showed that in areas where the fabric was exposed to solar radiation the absorptance increased by as much as 20 percent, and the peak difference was in the ultraviolet, indicating that the increased absorptance may have been due to radiation.

Many different individual assembly technologies would be needed in different combinations to serve many mission concepts. The many-to-many relationship between mission needs and technologies makes it difficult to determine exactly which specific technologies should receive priority for development and demonstration. Furthermore, because enabling technologies are still immature, no realistic, near-term design reference mission has been described that would form the basis for flowing down requirements for such development and demonstration. This broad applicability without a single, well-articulated mission makes it difficult to advance the technology all the way to flight readiness.

Next we outline the strategies the agency has invoked to engage the public in research, technology development, and other activities to advance and shape NASA¡¯s mission.

The first stage calls for action toward providing Security against current global threats by utilizing existing international institutions. These actions will create a stable base for the second stage, which would undertake substantive reform of the Outer Space Treaty to outline the standards and practices of space exploration in the next century, thereby incentivizing public-private partnerships while protecting the Parity of access to space for all nations. Finally, the third stage presents a possible structure for a transnational space authority that would embody the Civility of space exploration by ensuring that the peaceful uses of outer space are undertaken as an effort of all humankind.","Parsing the Role of Civil Space: A New Direction for "

As missions are increasing in length and duration, trash is a cost that must be reduced, and if this trash can be used to form useful parts, it is now a benefit. In order to enable the use of recyclable materials for launch packaging, the vibration energy attenuation behavior of these materials must be tested. In this paper, 3D printed parts with varying infill structures are vibration tested alongside an equivalent volume of foam material.

One is that the ISS does not have a habitation module; instead habitation features such as private crew quarters are dispersed across several modules, the galley is in the US Laboratory and the waste hygiene compartment is in a Node.

Classical passive landing gears areprone to tip-over when landing on highly uneven and inclined areas. To prevent the landerfrom overturning, it is necessary to make landing gear adaptable to wide variety of terraincondition. In order to achieve a robust landing on incline, we propose a new mechanism.In general, spacecraft tip over from the torque that is generated by the di erence betweenthe forces acting on each leg. However, it is di cult to synchronize the forces acting on allthe landing legs. Here, we focus on the di erence between the forces acting on each leg.In the case of touchdown on an incline, the forces acting on the upper leg is larger than onany other leg. Therefore, if we can convert this force to torque that opposes the directionof rotating of the spacecraft, it becomes possible to prevent the spacecraft from tippingover. We propose a translation{rotation motion conversion mechanism to enact the abovemethodology.

As a result, it is often necessary to consider multiple alternative departurewindows. To aid in mission planning activities, studies are periodically published thatcompile a list of candidate trajectories for use by the broader community. This practice iscommon for high-thrust trajectories where impulsive burn assumptions provide adequatefidelity for mission planning, allowing for straight-forward solutions to the Patched ConicApproximation. However, low-thrust missions are more complex, since trajectory solutionscannot be similarly decoupled from specific vehicle propulsion attributes such as thrust-toweightand specific impulse. This leads to a higher computational expense for developingcandidate trajectories; it also increases the dimensionality of the tables to be generated,resulting in the need for a much larger number of trajectories to be evaluated.","Response Surface Regressions for Low-Thrust"

The design demonstrates its capability for producing continuously the reciprocating moment of a magnetic piston using a Polarity Changer Timing Circuit (PCTC). The space broom is connected to the magnetic piston through a pivot point, with bearing and angular potentiometer, using cart and pole swing-up mechanism. The sweeping speed of the space broom can be altered, according to the mission requirements, by altering the reciprocating speed of the magnetic piston by varying the pole strengths of the magnetic heads and the timing of the PCTC. The proposed dual-head electromagnetic variable speed propulsion system offers various other applications for devising the sub-systems for space exploration probes, planet impact spinning probe, space stations, and satellites. The uniqueness of this system comes from the fact that at the propelling conditions the system can be effectively integrated with a connecting rod and a crank shaft for getting a rotary motion for various systems and subsystems applications while sweeping the broom continuously for space debris mitigation. We concluded that the design optimization of a dual-head electromagnetic variable sweeping speed space broom is a meaningful objective for space debris mitigation lucratively.","Dual-head Electromagnetic Variable Sweeping Speed  "

The network is supported by a parent craft, Mars Aerial NuclearGlobal Landing Explorer(MANGLE). The rest of the four crafts are the offspring craft, MarsAerial and Surface Terrain Electric Robots(MASTER) powered by Li-ion batteries at low cost.The MANGLE powered by nuclear fission reactor is also a mobile power station to charge thebatteries of the MASTER. The robotic network will move together on Martian atmosphereand land on any location of interest. Each robot will carry instrumentation for atmosphericsurvey, high resolution cameras for topographical survey, and deep drill for soil sample deeperthan 1m. The whole mission period is four Martian years. MANGLE can work all seasons onMars. However, due to the operating temperature limitation of the batteries, MASTER willonly operate during the summer season of Mars, hibernate in the winter, and operate again inthe next summer. For the whole mission, the MARGEN will survey a total area coverage of13,210,675.808 km2 (9.12% of Mars surface). The cost of one MASTER is about 1/1000 of theMANGLE, but a MASTER can almost perform the same exploration missions as the MANGLEsystem.

Successful assessment of existing HVAC systems enables timely repair and better retrofit avoiding unnecessary energy waste. Current processes of data collection and building thermal load modeling, however, require a large amount of time and effort. For a district energy system, which is composed of a fleet of buildings connected to a centeral plant, the current modeling processes are even more challenging. To address this problem, this paper presents a simple and scalable first-order thermal modeling approach. The proposed model is a simple heat transfer model, and it is scalable to various types of buildings by physical properties such as building materials, size, areas by HVAC intensity zones, etc. For the sake of simplification of the problem, only a cooling system is considered in this initial work. The proposed method was verified by the actual measurement data gathered from a university campus district energy system.

First, the theory of wind turbines is reviewed, with special focus on the effects which maximize power output. Then, elements of the physical explanation are formulated in three hypotheses, which are proved via data from scaled wind tunnel experiments and CFD simulations. The wind tunnel tests involved a set of scaled wind turbines tested in an open loop atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel. Then, CFD simulations were performed of the same cases by representing the turbines via porous actuator discs. The theory, experiment and CFD results were used in concert to explain the physical mechanism of the power increase, namely that power (and efficiency) can only be maximized if the streamtube generated by the wind turbine has a special, ¡°ideal¡± shape. It is demonstrated that this can be achieved without employing a solid structure ¨C such as a classical shroud, - but by using the neighbouring turbines¡¯ wakes to control the shape of the wind turbine wake, thus creating a virtual, or ¡°synthetic shroud¡± effect. The results lead to a 7% increase of power in comparison to a single wind turbine in isolation.","¡°Synthetic shroud¡± concept for wind turbine performance "

3107,AIAA-2016-4637,High Intensity Combustion of Methane and Propane using Oxygen Enhanced Air,"Different strategies have been explored for our quest to reduce pollutants emission and foster cleaner air under high intensity combustion condition that are relevant for power generation using land based gas turbine engines. Colorless distributed combustion (CDC) has been shown to provide significant reduction of pollutants emission as well as stable and distributed combustion in the combustor. Oxygen enhanced combustion (OEC) offers beneficial aspects to enhance combustion efficiency and stability in particular under lean operational condition. This paper provides combined hybrid approach of the two different strategies of CDC and OEC using two different types of hydrocarbon fuels on combustion and emission characteristics. The influence of oxygen enriched air for combustion of methane and propane fuels under non-premixed and premixed lean conditions was examined. The data are provided on the emission of NO and CO, and OH* chemiluminescence intensity distribution using these fuels. A cylindrical combustor was used at combustion intensity of 36MW/m3.atm at constant heat load of 6.25 kW. Progressive increase in oxygen concentration from to 21% to 24% or 27% increased the NO and decreased CO emission at all the equivalence ratios examined. However, steady combustion could be achieved at lower equivalence ratios with oxygen enriched air for both the fuels. Propane showed higher NO and lower CO emission than methane. The exit temperature of the combustor was higher with propane than methane. Increased oxygen concentration resulted in increased OH* Chemiluminescence intensity with the reaction zone to shift upstream and resulted in improved distributed combustion for both the fuels. The OH* Chemiluminescence intensity was higher with propane than methane. These results provide the role of fuel property and oxygen enrichment of air on combustion and emission under high intensity lean combustion conditions for stationary power applications.","High Intensity Combustion of Methane and Propane with "

3109,AIAA-2016-4794,Investigations into the thermal performance of a helically coiled closed loop oscillating heat pipe,"A numerical and experimental investigation has been carried out to evaluate the thermal performance of a helically coiled closed loop oscillating heat pipe (OHP). The OHP was designed to have its condenser and evaporator sections helically coiled to fit around a cylindrical packed bed vessel to offer a wider surface area of contact for enhanced heat transfer via the walls. The numerical investigation was carried out using an explicit Eulerian Volume of Fluid (VOF) model in ANSYS Fluent R15.0. Three working fluids within the required operating temperature range having suitable properties and compatible with copper were used to fill the OHPs to a volume fraction of 0.6. User defined functions (UDFs) were developed for realistic boundary conditions. The numerical results show that the OHPs at different heat inputs were still able to maintain a good temperature difference between the evaporator and condenser sections. The numerical model overall was able to give indication of the internal working conditions of the OHPs. For the experimental study, prototypes of the numerical models were developed and tested under laboratory conditions. Here OMEGA k-type thermocouples were used to obtain temperature data from the evaporator and condenser sections. The experimental results showed that the OHPs had the ability to maintain evaporator ¨C condenser temperature difference at varied heat inputs. Thermal performance was found to be significantly different at start-up for the three working fluids, however overtime only a slight variation in thermal performance was observed at the varied heat inputs. Overall, there was reasonable agreement between experimental and the numerical study.","Centre for Sustainable Energy Technologies (CSET), The University of Nottingham Ningbo China, 199Taikang East Road, Ningbo "

3112,AIAA-2016-5006,Lumped Parameter Modelling and Testing of a Free Piston Stirling Engine Heat Exchanger Using Laminated Woven Copper Wire Mesh as Heat Transfer Areas,"This paper presents a mathematical model and testing of a free-piston Stirling Engine (SE) Heat Exchangers (HEs) using laminated woven copper wire mesh as heat transfer areas. Free-piston SE HEs consist of an assembly of three key components, namely, the heater, cooler and regenerator generally referred to as regenerative heat exchanger. Senda and Dobson investigated the thermo-fluid characteristics of a regenerative compact heat exchanger using woven copper wire mesh as heat transfer medium in a uni-directional flow regime. A lumped parameter modeling was used to describe the thermo-fluid dynamic behaviour of the as designed regenerative heat exchanger in a fluctuating flow regime. Emphasis was placed on the third order approach, the so-called lumped parameter modeling of a Free-piston SE heat exchanger. In order to validate the SE heat exchanger theoretical model, Senda and Dobson conducted a preliminary experimental investigation tha gave results for a uni-directional flow data measurements, thereafter a main testing phase was carried out in fluctuating flow regime experimental investigation as discussed in this paper. Results obtained from the preliminary phase of experiments were used as a reference to validate the theoretical model that predict the heat exchanger heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops. During the preliminary phase of experiments, a deviation in the predicted results compared to the experimental results was noted. This deviation of the predicted results was due to a lack of published information and little progress made in attempts to analytically or numerically predict the heat transfer coefficients and friction factors for heat exchangers using woven wire mesh. Senda and Dobson adjusted a regenerative heat exchanger theoretical model so that it simulated the experimental heat exchanger characteristic parameters in a uni-directional flow regime. This was done by identifying the flow and geometrical variables influencing the regenerative heat exchanger theoretical results. It was found that in heat exchanger using woven wire mesh all geometrical variables influencing the theoretical results are captured in the porosity, while all flow variables are captured in the Reynolds number. Both the Reynolds number and porosity are captured in the thermal resistance. The experimentally calculated thermal resistance of the heater, cooler and regenerator was set as a reference to correct their respective porosities. The porosity is defined as the ratio of the wire mesh volume in the control volume to the total volume of the control volume, and its correction allows a volume of wire mesh correction and, by extension the number of laminating screens in the heat exchanger, and therefore the flow resistances. Hence, the porosity correction has led to the correction of the heat transfer coefficients and the pressure drop correlations used in the simulation of a free-piston SE heat exchanger using woven wire mesh, which now better predicts the experiments to meet the requirements of this paper.","Lumped Parameter Modelling and Testing of a Free Piston "
3113,AIAA-2016-4561,A CFD Investigation of Multiple Burner Ignition and Flame Propagation with Detailed Chemistry and Automatic Meshing,"Ignition in gas turbine combustor is exceedingly important for both aviation and power producing engines. Issues such as high-altitude relight, multiple burner ignition and flame propagation have traditionally not been amenable to Computational Fluid Dynamic investigations due to the use of simplified global kinetic mechanisms and the inability to model ignition accurately from a flame kernel generated by a spark and subsequently propagating to multiple burners. Recently, an excellent experimental study has provided a validation quality data on the ignition and flame propagation of an up-fired, natural gas five burner array8. The dataset provides required information on the location, size and duration of ignition source, fuel-air mixing and fluid dynamic structures in the experimental rig that has been used to validate CFD models for ignition and flame propagation. This study focuses on investigating the impacts of detailed chemistry and turbulence modeling options on ignition simulation initiated using an electrical spark in a linear array of five non-premixed natural gas burners. Fuel is injected directly as a single jet in each burner and is surrounded by air from radial swirlers giving an overall equivalence ratio of 0.66. The CFD modeling approach in this work utilizes an automatically generated mesh with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) to capture gradients in temperature, velocity and other variables to predict the growth and propagation of the flame kernel. The ignition sequence begins with non-reacting fuel and air flow that is given sufficient time to reach a statistically steady-state. Ignition using an electric spark igniter is modeled directly to match energy output, duration and kernel size. The efficacy of URANS and detailed chemistry along with AMR, is investigated in capturing spark kernel, flame propagation, and subsequent stabilization in swirl cups. Results show that turbulence models in URANS framework and detailed chemistry along with grid-convergent mesh sizes through AMR can accurately predict ignition from burner to burner. We also study the efficacy of URANS with AMR in capturing time-averaged velocity profiles and recirculation zones and compare against experimental data.","AIAA Propulsion & Energy 2016 Conference "

This methodology is applied to a specific single-spool turbojet engine configuration. A generic compressor performance map along with simplified component performance characterizations are first utilized in order to provide comprehensive traditional engine performance results (engine thrust, mass capture, and RPM), for on and off-design engine operation. Details of exergy destruction in engine components, across the entire engine, and in the engine wake are then provided and the performance losses associated with this entropy generation are discussed. Results are provided across the engine operating envelope defined by operational ranges of flight Mach number, altitude, and fuel throttle setting. The wake losses occurring in the engine wake and their impact on the correct quantitative characterization of actual performance losses associated with the operation of a turbojet engine are shown to be dominant with respect to other losses, including all losses occurring inside the engine. Specifically, the ratio of the exergy destruction rate in the wake to the exergy destruction rate inside the engine itself ranges from 1 to 2.5 across the operational envelope of the engine.","Exergy-Based Performance Analysis of a Turbojet Engine  "
3115,AIAA-2016-4648,The Effect of Axial Spacing of Constant and Variable Blockages on the Deflagration to Detonation Transition in a Pulse Detonation Engine,"An investigation was conducted into the effects of obstacle spacing on the deflagration-to-detonation transition section length in a pulse detonation engine. Testing was conducted with one hundred and ninety-five different obstacle, and spacing configurations. The configurations included constant, as well as variable spacing between obstacles. The goal of this investigation was to correlate the spacing between obstacles and the blockage ratio of the obstacles with the detonation success and the shortening of the DDT section. The ten cases that achieved the highest percentage of detonations were investigated further to determine the distance needed for the deflagration-to-detonation transition. A 33% blockage ratio was the most successful to induce turbulence and not quench the detonation wave. With these conditions, DDT was achievable with 100% success in a section whose length was 31 times the inner diameter of the DDT section. Detonation was unachievable in 82 times the inner diameter in a ¡°smooth¡± tube. This is a greater than 63% decrease in detonation transition length. This decrease in length will further facilitate the integration of pulse detonation engines into gas turbine engines.1","The Effect of Axial Spacing of Constant and Variable "

In this experimental study using a dump combustor with a bluff-body stabilized flame, we characterize the variation of this intermittent behavior as we approach blowout using recurrence quantification analysis and thereby provide viable precursors to an impending blowout. We observe that as blowout is approached, the system exhibits increased aperiodicity in oscillations. Using statistical quantities estimated from the recurrence plots, such as recurrence rate, trapping time and entropy of diagonal lines, we characterize the variations in the dynamic characteristics of the pressure fluctuations as the lean blowout is approached. Further, we suggest a method of recurrence quantification analysis that is computationally less expensive and hence more suitable for online prognosis of dynamic transitions in a turbulent combustor.","Precursors to blowout in a turbulent combustor based on "

The divergence angle for each channel wasmeasured in both modes using a near- eld Faraday probe. In single channel mode, pressurewas controlled via downstream injection as well as by owing through the non-operatingchannel. Results show that thrust increases 5% and 11% in dual channel mode versus thesummation of single-channels for high and low power operation respectively. When pres-sure is controlled via channel injection, thrust numbers for dual channel operation and thesummation of single channel operation match.

These two concepts are optimized near wall cooling passages and a triple-impingement configuration in the vane trailing edge. Finally this study explores a CFD conjugate analysis based on the Shear Stress Transport k-¦Ø turbulence model. The overall goal is to produce a more effective cooling configuration by studying the effects of the flow and heat transfer of the dual configuration, while keeping the integrity of the turbine vane. Star-CCM+ was utilized to carry out the computational data on a 3-D model of the NASA C3X turbine vane. The analysis compared the temperature and the overall heat transfer coefficient to several data sets from the literature at the vane mid span with a heavy emphasis on the trailing edge portion of turbine vane. Results are generated to show the nature of the flow induced by the coupled system and the thermomechanical performance and the efficiency of the turbine vane. The triple impingement configuration displayed a cooler average temperature distribution of 18.8% than the original NASA C3X vane and a slightly cooler temperature of 2.2% than the original micro-cooling configuration from the literature. Strictly the back 1/3rd of the vane for the triple impingement configuration produced a 2.8%-3.3% cooler average temperature than the original micro-cooling configuration and a 14.7%-18.95% cooler vane than the original NASA C3X vane.

Consequently, there can be a weight benefit to mounting modular electronic hardware on the engine core casing in a high temperature environment.

High speed, backlit imaging was used to capture the physical response of impact waves present on impingement sheet formed by two like on like impinging jets. Dynamic mode decomposition was used to extract the natural frequencies of impact waves and isolate the spatial structures response present on the impingement sheet due to the transverse acoustic forcing. Chamber pressure and jet velocity were varied until impact waves became visually prominent. After impact waves became visually prominent, the impingement sheet was subjected to incremental pressure amplitudes in a pressure anti-node (PAN) and pressure node (PN) configurations.

The Isp enhancement, is based on the instantaneous heating of the propellantby the use of the huge neutronic flux from the pulse which is not limited by thermodynamic constraints.However, within the framework of this concept -and if important Isp augmentation is pursued, the energyfrom the fission fragments is an ¡±unwanted energy¡± and must be evacuated by a solidary quenching systemworking in-parallel with the propellant channel.

Test articles were implemented in ¡®closed¡¯ (self-contained) system configuration for operation in modulated power mode on a flex-pendulum thrust stand, using a high sensitivity piezoceramic strain transducer and laser vibration sensing techniques. Although no propulsive effect was observed under activation of the devices in non-modulated operating mode, via a very sensitive torsion pendulum setup with laser measurement techniques, anomalous thrusts were persistently found by activation in modulated mode with modulation frequencies close to the second natural frequency of the flex-pendulum setup. Intensive numerical and statistical data processing of these anomalous results leaves no room for explanation by conventional physical mechanisms. Furthermore, the modulated thrusts were found to be consistent with actual alternate thrusts ranging from newtons to tens of kilonewtons, depending on whether the force producing mechanism is linear or quadratic w.r.t. the modulation frequency. These results present indeed a challenge to current paradigms while leaving the question about its origin wide open.","Anomalous Electromagnetically Induced Propulsion Effects "

Nine five-second static firing tests were carriedout on a 2kN-class Cascaded Multistage Impinging-jet type hybrid rocket motor undervarying oxidizer flowrates to evaluate the accuracy of NTRT results. Nozzle throat erosionhistories calculated by NTRT agreed well with measured values for initial and final nozzlethroat radius, and successfully reconstructed the case where no measureable amount ofnozzle throat erosion occurred. For equivalence ratios 0.6-1.4, the relationship betweennozzle throat erosion rate and equivalence ratio determined by NTRT displays a trendconsistent with chemical kinetic limited heterogeneous combustion theory, as well aspredictions made by previous researchers. A numerical simulation was carried out toinvestigate the applicability of an alternative computational technique which uses a nozzleexit pressure measurement as input data, and revealed that pressure in vicinity of the staticpressure port is likely to deviate from centerline pressure by up to 0.1 [MPa] or 30%.","Method for Determining                                                     "
3136,AIAA-2016-5210,Mars Sphere of Influence Maneuvers for NASAâs Evolvable Mars Campaign,"NASA¡¯s Human Spaceflight Architecture Team is refining human exploration architectures that will extend human presence to the Martian surface. For both Mars orbital and surface missions, NASA¡¯s Evolvable Mars Campaign assumes that cargo and crew can be delivered repeatedly to the same destination. Up to this point, interplanetary trajectories have been optimized to minimize the total propulsive requirements of the in-space transportation systems, while the pre-deployed assets and surface systems are optimized to minimize their respective propulsive requirements separate from the in-space transportation system. There is a need to investigate the coupled problem of optimizing the interplanetary trajectory and optimizing the maneuvers within Mars¡¯s sphere of influence. This paper provides a description of the ongoing method development, analysis and initial results of the effort to resolve the discontinuity between the interplanetary trajectory and the Mars sphere of influence trajectories. Assessment of Phobos and Deimos orbital missions shows the in-space transportation and crew taxi allocations are adequate for missions in the 2030s. Because the surface site has yet to be selected, the transportation elements must be sized to provide enough capability to provide surface access to all landing sites under consideration. Analysis shows access to sites from elliptical parking orbits with a lander that is designed for sub-periapsis landing location is either infeasible or requires expensive orbital maneuvers for many latitude ranges. In this case the locus of potential arrival perigee vectors identifies the potential maximum north or south latitudes accessible. Higher arrival velocities can decrease reorientation costs and increase landing site availability. Utilizing hyperbolic arrival and departure vectors in the optimization scheme will increase transportation site accessibility and provide more optimal solutions.","Optimizing Mars Sphere of Influence Maneuvers for "

This class of trajectories is advantageous for potential Mars at-mospheric sample return missions because of its low geocentric energy at departure andarrival, because it would enable two sample collections at unique locations during di erentMartian seasons, and because of its lack of deterministic maneuvers. Free return opportu-nities are documented over Earth departure dates ranging from 2015 through 2100, withviable missions available every Earth-Mars synodic period. With an estimated maximumlift-to-drag ratio less than one, a minimum Earth departure hyperbolic excess speed of3.23 km/s, a minimum Earth atmospheric entry speed of 11.42 km/s, and a minimumight time of 805 days are observed. An algorithm using simpli ed dynamics is developedalong with a method to derive an initial estimate for trajectories in a more realistic dy-namic model.

Multi-element expansion models can achieve betterperformance for such systems by decomposing the random input space and generatingindividual PCEs for each component element. This study uses an adaptive approach togenerating multi-element PCEs for the modeling of uncertainty propagation both for aspacecraft in a Molniya orbit about the Earth and for a spacecraft conducting a double-yby during a satellite tour at an outer planet. It is shown that, in these applications, themulti-element models can achieve much more rapid convergence in the  nal state statis-tics compared to a Monte Carlo simulation and 1-2 orders of magnitude improvement inaccuracy over a global PCE.","Multi-Element Trajectory Models for Satellite Tour"

One idea to accomplish this is telecommunication via a satellite orbiting the L2 point. However, because orbits around the L2 point are unstable, active control is necessary. In this paper, we propose an orbital design and control laws for a combination of solar electric propulsion and a solar sail equipped with reflectivity control devices (RCDs). An artificial halo orbit that takes the solar radiation pressure into consideration is designed, and the modeling error is calculated. Feedback control laws to maintain the orbit are designed using a backstepping method. From the numerical simulations, it is shown that the utilization of RCDs reduces the fuel consumption required to maintain the orbit.","Orbital Control of a Solar Sail Using                      "

To deal with theseissues, this paper presents two new methods adopt a definition of the real root mean square(RMS) errors between a DMR and its desired working surface. Different from conventionalmethods, the new methods allow the nodes of a DMR to move away from the desiredworking surface, so as to have more freedom to improve surface accuracy.

However, the classical models mainly considered that temperature constrols the radiation, others are based on the spectral radiation emitted by the flame products and, the more detailed models, in the geometric and flame composition. In other hand, there are simple models, which works as engineering tools for quick calculus and aproximations. Moreover, there are models that predict the detailed energy radiated in the near field, and also, models developed in order to estimate aproximated energy to the far field. Many effort were taken by different authors to develop the models, nevertheless, they are found untied in the literature. Thus, the present study consists in compare the flames thermal radiation results of experiments with those calculated theoreticaly appling several models.

3168,AIAA-2017-0818,Evaluation of a Simple UQ Approach to Compensate for Sparse Stress-Strain Curve Data in Solid Mechanics Applications,"lids, walls, and weld. Over 70 response quantities of interest (including displacements, stresses, strains, and calculated measures of material damage) at several locations on the can and various points in time are tracked in the simulations. Each response quantity¡¯s behavior varies according to the particular stress-strain curves used for the materials in the model. We estimate response variability due to variability of the input material curves. When only a few stress-strain curves are available from material testing, response variance will usually be significantly underestimated. This is undesirable for many engineering purposes. A simple classical statistical method, Tolerance Intervals (TIs), is tested for effectively compensating for sparse stress-strain curve data in the can-crush problem. The method is found to perform well on the highly nonlinear input-to-output response mappings and non-standard response distributions in the can-crush UQ problem.","

From the information dilution theorem, when additional states are addedto a  lter with the number of observations held constant, the uncertainty in each statewill increase. Likewise, failure to compensate for uncertainty in system states and/orparameters requires process noise compensation which increases the uncertainty of theestimate. The system observability can be used to determine when enough informationexists to estimate additional states and which states can be appropriately estimated atthat time. Tracking examples of space objects in multiple orbit regimes from angles-onlydata are presented, examining the estimation accuracy and uncertainty for orbit and orbitwith area-to-mass ratio.

A polyhedral rover that uses CMGs to roll is being developed at Cornell University. Reaction wheels have been used in similar rovers to enable rolling motion, but CMGs have been explored only minimally. Nevertheless, their torque and energy efficiency make them ideal for rover applications. This new application motivates the development of design principles and controls architectures that use CMGs effectively. In particular, rover interactions with the ground can exploit different array configurations, singularity-avoidance methods, and array-conditioning methods, among others. This paper discusses how single CMG arrays can use the interaction with the ground to control the movement of a polyhedral rover. For the two single CMG configurations explored, simulation results show that the energy efficiency of the CMG polyhedral rover is better than that of a similar polyhedral rover using reaction wheels by 40 to 45 times.

Furthermore, an accurate landing site prediction facilitates recovery. This paperintroduces a six-degrees-of-freedom ight simulator for large unguided model rockets thatcan y to altitudes of up to 13 km and then return to earth by parachute. The open-sourcesoftware package assists the user with the design of rockets, and its simulation core modelsboth the rocket ight and the parachute descent in stochastic wind conditions. Further-more, the uncertainty in the input variables propagates through the model via a MonteCarlo wrapper, simulating a range of possible ight conditions. The resulting trajectoriesare captured as a Gaussian process, which assists in the statistical assessment of the ightconditions in the face of uncertainties, such as changes in wind conditions, failure to deploythe parachute, and variations in thrust. This approach also facilitates concise presentationof such uncertainties via visualisation of trajectory ensembles.","An open-source, stochastic, six-degrees-of-freedom"

The trajectory negotiation mechanism is formulated as n-player, finite strategy game. The objective of each aircraft in the game is to minimize its cost of deviating from its desired trajectory, while the objective of the controller is provide clearances that ensure fairness while preventing conflicts. In order to avoid the need to share competition sensitive business logic employed by individual aircraft, the utility function is formulated in terms of the percentage cost deviation for each aircraft. Penalty costs are defined based on the rule of the bargaining game, determined by ground controllers depending on the traffic situation. The final solution is chosen from the Nash equilibriums of the game, representing the best possible outcome for all the players in the game. The Nash equilibrium of the game is found using a Binary Mixed-Integer Linear Programming algorithm. The feasibility and the performance of the proposed game-theoretic trajectory-negotiation mechanism are demonstrated in a merging arrival traffic situation.","Game Theoretic Trajectory Negotiation Mechanism for "

In many applications, not only are sampling-based approximations theonly solution, but these samples are computationally-burdensome to obtain. This paperpresents a machine learning procedure for sampling-based approximations that activelyselects samples in order to maximize the accuracy of the approximation with a limitednumber of samples. Gaussian process regression models are constructed from a small setof training samples and used to approximate the robustness evaluation. Active learning isthen used to iteratively select samples that most improve this evaluation.

To addressthe high (possibly in nite) dimensional nature of the SLHS which leads to computationalcomplexity issues for formal veri cation, we propose an intent abstraction to obtain anintent-based MDP model for the automation while preserving the critical information formode confusion. The resultant intent-based MDPs for the automation and pilot can captureboth the relevant continuous and discrete uncertainties inherent in the pilot-automationinteraction system.

The unique cellular pattern of the proposed chiral structure leads to a large tailorability ofthe highly nonlinear mechanical response, while simultaneously allowing for high deformability under globalplanar deformations. These characteristics are exploited to design selectively compliant wing ribs to achievea reversible chordwise shape adaptation mechanism. The morphing capabilities of wing structures using theproposed chiral honeycomb as compliant ribs are assessed by means of finite elements calculations. The resultingwing design enables unique mechanical responses, such as large zero¨Csti ness phases. With the potential todrastically reduce the actuation requirements, these can be beneficially exploited for morphing techniques relyingon active methods. Purely passive shape adaptation can benefit from the eminent deformation¨Cdependentsti ness variation, showing potential to be successfully implemented for load alleviation purposes. Techniquesto further augment the design space of the proposed structural concept are introduced, allowing for even greatertailorability of the resulting mechanical response, and therefore extending the applicability of this technique forshape adaptation applications.","Shape Adaptation of Wing Structures by Chiral Structures"

3224,AIAA-2017-1562,Developing a Probabilistic Load Spectrum for Fatigue Modeling,"A common framework for data assimilation tasks for damage models is to use usagedata to propagate the model forward in time with periodic updating using inspectiondata. For example, consider a Dynamic Bayesian Network implementation where usagedata is streamed in as a model predicts accumulating damage over time. When full usagedata is not available, it must be modeled. Keeping with the probabilistic framework, aprobabilistic model of usage may be developed. Such a model can be used to  ll in missingdata or to forecast usage into the future. Building an accurate and updatable usage modelis important for accurate forecasting of damage which is often of interest.Consider usage modeling for aircraft structural damage. The task reduces to computinga probabilistic model of external wing loading for ights. Often, aircraft will be equippedwith onboard measurement devices which can record some aircraft states, potentially in-cluding external loading. Another source of data may be an aircraft simulation program.Such a simulation may only calculate external loading for a small time frame, for examplea maneuver. The goal in this work is to combine such sources of data (ight records fromdata recorders and ight simulations) to build a consistent probabilistic usage model foraircraft ights. In the end, the synthetic ights can be generated with the associated usagedata (e.g. wing loading).","Developing a Probabilistic Load Spectrum for Fatigue"

Motivated by Digital Twin, a structural health management (SHM)paradigm that integrates vehicle-speci c characteristics with continual in-situ damage di-agnosis and prognosis, the methods studied herein yield near real-time damage assessmentsthat could enable monitoring of a vehicle's health while it is operating (i.e., online SHM).High- delity modeling and uncertainty quanti cation (UQ), both critical to Digital Twin,are incorporated using  nite element method simulations and Bayesian inference, respec-tively. The crux of the proposed Bayesian diagnosis methods, however, is the reformulationof the numerical sampling algorithms (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo) used to generate theresulting probabilistic damage estimates. To this end, three distinct methods are demon-strated for rapid sampling that utilize surrogate modeling and exploit various degrees ofparallelism for leveraging HPC. The accuracy and computational e ciency of the methodsare compared on the problem of strain-based crack identi cation in thin plates.

Measurements ofstructural response are obtained either in-situ with mounted sensor networks or o ineusing more traditional techniques (e.g., nondestructive evaluation). Diagnosis algorithmsprocess this information to detect and quantify damage and then feed this data forward toa prognostic framework. A prognosis of the structure's future operational readiness (e.g.,remaining useful life or residual strength) is then made and is used to inform mission-critical decision-making. Years of research have been devoted to improving the elementsof this process, but the process itself has not changed signi cantly. Here, a new approachis proposed in which prognosis information is not only fed forward for decision-making,but it is also fed back to the forthcoming diagnosis. In this way, diagnosis algorithms cantake advantage of a priori information about the expected state of health, rather thanoperating in an uninformed condition. As a feasibility test, a diagnosis-prognosis feedbackloop of this manner is demonstrated. The approach is applied to a numerical examplein which fatigue crack growth is simulated in a simple aluminum alloy test specimen. Aprognosis was derived from a set of diagnoses which provided feedback to a subsequent setof diagnoses.

Active material-based origami structures with self-folding capabilities areparticularly needed in cases where it may be impractical to apply mechanical loads to exertthe desired folding deformation (as in remote applications such as in aerospace systems).Current models and design methods for origami are generally limited to the idealizationof the folds as creases of zeroth-order geometric continuity. For origami structures withsigni cant fold thickness or folded via active material actuation, such a representation isnot accurate. In such cases, the folds are properly represented through bent regions withhigher-order geometric continuity. These fold regions of higher-order geometric continu-ity are termed as smooth folds.

In natural environment, bamboo are tubular and exhibit excellent mechanical properties that can reduce self-weight effectively. In this paper, we proposed a new energy absorber structure named as bionic thin-walled tube inspired by the structure characteristics of the bamboo. Three kinds of bionic tube with different section shapes under axial loading conditions were investigated by nonlinear finite element method (FEM). The bionic tube was composed of 2 bionic nodes and 3 bionic inner tubes with 12, 8 and 4 bionic elements in each inner tube. The main parameters in the design of these bionic tubes are cross-section geometry, wall thickness and height. A progressive deformation mode was achieved under axial impact loading. After crash simulations, the peak crush force, energy absorbed, mean crush force, crush force efficiency and specific energy absorption (SEA) were obtained for a deformation length of 72 mm. The energy absorption characteristics of the bionic tube and the traditional circular and square tube with the same weights were compared. The results showed that the bionic tube had excellent energy absorption characteristics with a higher SEA. The effects of the wall thickness, the angle of the bionic unit and cross-sectional geometry on the energy absorption characteristics of the bionic tubes were examined numerically. Through parametric study, it was found that the thickness of the wall and the angle of the bionic unit had a significant effect on the crashworthiness performance of the bionic tube. The results showed that the bionic tube was exactly excellent energy absorber under axial impact compared with the common tube."," Structural bionic design for thin-walled energy absorber "

Multiple leading-edge-mounted engine masses presented a challenge to design a wing within acceptable limits for dynamic and aeroelastic stability. Because the first four primary bending eigenmodes of the proposed wing structure are very sensitive to outboard motor placement, safety-of-flight requirements drove the need for multiple spars, rib attachments, and outboard structural reinforcements in the design.","

The intent is to have this basis rely as little as possible on theexistence of snapshots of the temperature distribution obtained by full order computations, i.e.,finite element and CFD solutions, to reduce the numerical effort associated with theirdetermination. To this end, the core of the basis is first constructed from the recently introducedoptimum thermal modes which are the temperature distributions that most strongly affect thestructural response and thus are independent of the applied heat flux. It is shown that this basis isnot sufficient and thus a limited number of enrichments are introduced that do come from suchfull order computations and which complete the basis. The approach is demonstrated on arepresentative hypersonic panel in fully coupled aero-structural-thermal interaction.","A CONSTRUCTION OF THERMAL BASIS FUNCTIONS FOR COUPLED "

The study focuses on a stiffened panel configuration, originally designed by the Boeing Company,that is subjected to combined pressure and heat flux loads from a Mach 7 flow. The nonlinear structural /thermal ROMs rely on the identification of suitable bases to accurately represent the panel to anticipatedloading. The structural bases are a combination of linear free vibration modes, dual modes that capture thein-plane response, and enrichment modes that capture the structural response due to thermal loads. Thethermal bases include temperature distributions that are derived from the dominant bases in the structuralROM and enrichments that capture the effect of the anticipated fluid loading.","Full and Reduced Order Aerothermoelastic Modeling of Built-Up Aerospace "

Thefirst DCGMF is based on the information weighted consensus algorithm while the secondDCGMF utilizes the diffusion strategy that requires less number of information exchangesamong sensor nodes. The third DCGMF is based on the iterative covariance intersectionstrategy that is the variant of the conventional covariance intersection algorithm. Theperformance of these three DCGMFs are compared via a maneuvering target trackingproblem using multiple sensors. The simulation results show that both the consensus anddiffusion based DCGMFs approximate the centralized filtering results very well whereas thecovariance intersection based DCGMF does not. In addition, the diffusion strategy basedDCGMF outperforms the consensus based DCGMF when new measurements must beprocessed timely and the number of allowable iterations of the consensus is limited.","Distributed Cubature Gaussian Mixture Filters "

The existing off-axisnoise input method, which is used for reducing the correlation between the primary andsecondary inputs, has a difficult-to-obtain convergence condition under the hold trim state.In addition, the existing method cannot easily identify high frequency dynamics due to theoff-axis input noise. On the other hand, the proposed identification method relied on acomputer-generated sweep in the frequency-domain, which could produce a more accuratemodel than the existing perturbation model. Moreover, the proposed conditional attitudehold logic described the actual pilot's motion by activating the controller when the Eulerangle measurements exceeded a pre-defined angle. The proposed method was used with theBo-105 helicopter nonlinear simulation model, and the identified coupled rotor/fuselagenine-degree-of-freedom results were reliable and comparable to those obtained with theexisting perturbation model.","Helicopter Dynamic Model Identification using  "

3248,AIAA-2017-1265,Re-entry Guidance for Path-Constraint Tracking,"To limit the mass of the vehicle's thermal protection system, an optimal trajectory thatminimises the total integrated heat load should be own. In essence this boils down totracking the maximum heat-ux constraint for as long as possible, until the maximummechanical loads are encountered. Flying as close to this load as possible contributesto minimising the heat load as well. A combination of a semi-analytical guidance thatproduces nominal bank-angle commands and a tracking system based on a (linear) output-feedback controller is considered for tracking the path constraints. The tracking system hasa fast response, although its robustness is sometimes doubtful due to insu cient damping.Both guidance components are reviewed and improved with respect to an earlier design.(Almost) discrete jumps in commanded bank angle are avoided by implementation of ananalytical smooth step function. Transition from heat-ux tracking to controlling the maxi-mum allowable g-load is achieved by a smooth interpolation between the respective trackingconstants that are both a function of the product of atmospheric density and a polynomialterm of ight velocity.","Re-entry Guidance for Path-Constraint Tracking"

First, the line of sight rate is driven tozero to ensure the intercept. Second, an outer loop is integrated for impact angle control.After extracting the guidance commands, the guidance gains are made to vary throughoutflight in order to avoid singularity of the guidance command and increase the impact anglezone. The varying gain guidance configuration turns the proposed guidance scheme into awell-known linear optimal guidance law structure.

On one hand,we need robust control laws in the low level layer to stabilize the vehicle and track references (such as airspeed,desired attitude, etc.), which must be implemented safely in the overall flight envelopes. On the other hand,we need accurate guidance logics in the high level layer to steer the vehicle converging to a predefined pathto fulfill the missions. However, most guidance logics implemented to follow the desired geometrical path andcontrol schemes employed to minimize the cross track error are designed separately. To obtain a combinationof fast convergence and minor overshoot compared with the LOS algorithm with a constant lookahead distance,a modified MPC scheme integrated with the integral LOS guidance logic is proposed to generate an optimallookahead distance along the error model of the UAV, which is defined in Frenet-Serret frame with controlconstraints considered explicitly. Reasonable decision of the lookahead distance is incorporated into the MPCdesign process and quadratic programming (QP) method is employed to solve the problem of MPC. Curved pathfollowing performances of the vehicle with fixed and variable lookahead distances are provided in high-fidelitysemi-physical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed control strategy.","Model Predictive Control Based Integral Line-of-Sight Curved"

A pre-strain test is conducted to generate residual tensile stress, which serves as a steady stress when the specimen is subjected to vibration-based fatigue loads. This steady tensile stress is desired at the fatigue zone of the test article, but is the result of an adjacent compressive region in equilibrium, and as such a Finite Element Model (FEM) is necessary to determine the stress distribution throughout the entire sample. The goal of this work is to improve the FEM analysis associated with the pre-strain method for better validation of ¡°steady stress¡± generation for Goodman data fatigue assessment. Improvements were made to the FEM by more effectively incorporating empirical tensile stress-strain behavior with a higher fidelity material model, in addition to more accurately representing the pressures and forces acting on the specimen during localized monotonic loading. Validations of improvements to the pre-strain steady stress generation method will be demonstrated on Aluminum (Al) 6061-T6 by comparing strain field results from strain gages and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to FEM analysis.","

However, the aircraft model estima-tion performance can be severely degraded with an active control system and high inputcollinearity such as those found on a quadrotor unmanned aircraft. Orthogonal multisineinput signals are superimposed with the active control system and utilized for real-time re-cursive Fourier Transform Regression parameter estimation. Experiments were conductedwith varying input signal amplitudes and regressor model structures. Each con gura-tion was evaluated on a quadrotor with nominal hardware conditions and with a damagedpropeller. Flight test generated parameter estimates were compared with benchmark mo-tor/propeller values. The results indicate as the multisine amplitude increases, the iden-ti ability of individual actuator e ectiveness increases with a model structure containingeach actuator. However, the increasing multisine amplitude induces unwanted rotationalperturbations. Roll and pitch model parameter estimates can be quickly and accuratelyestimated with the estimate methodology with approximately double the perturbationscompared with solely the ight controller. Overall, a well designed coupled multisine inputsignal and Fourier Transform regression provides an e cient, accurate real-time parame-ter estimation technique that can e ectively overcome challenges imposed by closed loopsystem identi cation systems with high input collinearity.","Improved Persistent Excitation for Real Time"

Representing scenario models graphically, increases effectiveness of communication by providing fast, easy, and accurate method of transferring information among interested parties. It is well known that graphical diagrams are more effective than text in the communication between end-users and/or domain experts. As such, models are majorly delivered graphically and supported by graphical design and editing tools.

A previous design obtained followinga multi-disciplinary optimization technique, yielding the ideal structural and geometri-cal parameters maximizing roll controllability, is utilized as the baseline individual. Theglobal design of the morphing, however, did not optimize explicitly, the thickness of thedistributed piezoelectric actuators and the underlying skin. This investigation thereforefocuses on further extending the design space by perturbing the original optimal individualand conducting a parameter search for the ideal thickness distribution between the piezo-electric actuators and the substrate morphing skin. The goal is to maximize the obtainedrolling moment while minimizing the mass. This is achieved by implementing a concurrentaero-structural loop in which the servo-aero-elastic behavior is evaluated until convergenceis reached. The results show that the initial design chosen as a baseline was signi cantlyclose to obtaining the maximum rolling moment. The maximum increase in rolling momentachieved by altering the thickness distribution is 6.75% along with a 6.35% mass penalty.When constraining the mass, however, the possible increase is only 1.35%.

Whereas a Monte Carlo (MC) approach would lead tothe sought level of POE with a daunting number of simulations, IS-based techniques arepromising as they target the sampling of the input parameters on the parts of the distri-butions that are most responsible for the extreme loads, thus reducing the number of runsrequired. We compared the various methods on select load channels as output from FAST,an aero-hydro-servo-elastic tool for the design and analysis of wind turbines developed bythe National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Our newly devised method, althoughstill in its infancy in terms of tuning of the subparameters, is comparable to the othersin terms of load estimation and its variance versus computational cost, and o ers greatpromise going forward due to the incorporation of adaptivity into the already powerfulimportance sampling concept.","Advances in the Assessment of Wind Turbine"

3287,AIAA-2017-1359,Bifurcations of limit-cycle oscillations of a two degree-of-freedom airfoil caused by aerodynamic non-linearities,"Flutter is usually predicted using linearised theory. In reality, flutter is always non-linearand might already occur below the linearly predicted flutter boundary. Whether this isthe case for limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs) caused by aerodynamic non-linearities is notknown, since these LCOs can only be predicted using expensive wind-tunnel tests or cou-pled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-Computational Structural Mechanics (CSM)simulations. However, it is important to know whether a sufficiently large disturbance canalready cause LCOs below the flutter boundary predicted from linearised theory. Further-more, since structural properties and the flow conditions will vary, it is necessary to studythe resulting variations of the Hopf bifurcation behaviour of the LCO solutions near theflutter point. In this work viscous and inviscid transonic flows are considered. The LCObifurcation behaviour was found to vary significantly when the uncoupled structural natu-ral frequency ratio and the location of the elastic axis are changed. When the non-linearityis relatively weak, a change in the Hopf bifurcation type might result.","Bifurcations of limit-cycle oscillations of a two"

The tailoring of aeroelastic responses therefore offers potential weight savings. In this paper, the spars and stringers planform geometry (i.e. shape and root/tip chord wise location) on a representative wind tunnel model aircraft wing are used to modify the wing aeroelastic performance. Several optimisations are performed to illustrate the ability of the spars and stringers planform geometrical features to change the wing vibrational mode natural frequencies, deformation under a static tip load and aerodynamic load, gust response and aeroelastic instability speed. Changing the stringers planform geometry is shown to offer minor variation in the wing deformation and loads. Changing the spars planform geometry is shown to enable a reduction in root bending moment under static aerodynamic loading greater than 10%, a reduction in maximum root bending moment encounter during a worst case scenario gust event greater than 10% and a 25% increase in flutter speed. The improvements due to a change in the spar planform geometry are compared to the effect of changing the wing sweep angle. A framework to characterise Euler-Bernoulli beam properties on wings with geometric coupling is then developed and validated to relate the stiffness and bend/twist coupling parameter to the full 3D FE models.","

A finite element model is developed to assess the effect of circular facesheet-core disbonds on the strength of sandwich specimens subjected to edgewise compressive loads for the purpose of predicting the critical flaw size for a variety of design parameters. Postbuckling analyses are conducted in which an initial imperfection is seeded using results from a linear buckling analysis. Both the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) and cohesive elements are considered for modeling disbond growth. Predictions from analyses using the VCCT and analyses using cohesive elements are in good correlation. A series of parametric analyses are conducted to investigate the effect of core thickness and material, facesheet layup, facesheet-core interface properties, and curvature on the criticality of facesheet-core disbonds of various sizes. The results from these analyses provide a basis for determining the critical flaw size for facesheet-core disbonds subjected to edgewise compression loads and, therefore, nondestructive evaluation flaw detection requirements for this configuration.","A Numerical Study on the Edgewise Compression Strength "

Based on the results of an experiment which was designed to probe workload primary drivers, a method is developed that estimates pilot spare capacity from readily observable measures and is tested for generality using multi-axis flight data.","Novel Estimation of Pilot Performance Characteristics "

3313,AIAA-2017-1394,Control-Oriented System and Parameter Identification of a Small Flexible Flying-Wing Aircraft,"High aspect ratio lightweight and flexible aircraft are becoming increasingly popular dueto attractive performance features including high lift-to-drag ratios and low mass; all leadingto low fuel burn. As aircraft become more flexible, rigid-body and flexible dynamics becomehighly coupled, posing challenges in aircraft design, modeling, and control. Active fluttersuppression becomes a requirement for these aircraft to maintain stability and performancein the operational envelope. This paper addresses the modeling challenges as it describes thesystem and parameter identification of a small, flexible, high-aspect ratio, flying-wing aircraftwith asymmetry in the wing stiffness. Several flight tests of this aircraft were performed atvarious airspeeds with various excitation inputs. Completely analytical mathematical modelswere also constructed for this aircraft independently. System and parameter identificationmethods in both the time and frequency domains were leveraged using the flight test data andmodels to create a control-oriented, flight-test-data-enhanced, parameter-varying model ofthe aircraft, ideal for control system design and simulation validation.

3314,AIAA-2017-1015,A Cooperative Differential Game for Imposing a Relative Intercept Angle,"A cooperative guidance law for a team of interceptors trying to intercept, from mul-tiple directions, an evading target is proposed. An example scenario of interest is thatof intercepting an aerial target, such as a ballistic missile, from multiple directions. Theengagement is analyzed in the framework of a linear quadratic zero-sum two-person dif-ferential game, where the team of interceptors constitutes one of the adversaries and thetarget the other. Arbitrary number of interceptors, each having linear dynamics, is consid-ered. The obtained guidance law for the team of interceptors enables enforcing a relativegeometry in-between the group of missiles and the target. Such an approach is superior,in the sense of the required control effort, to that where each interceptor independentlyenforces, using a one-on-one strategy, a preselected intercept angle that satisfies the rela-tive intercept requirement. A nonlinear two dimensional simulation is used to investigatethe performance of the obtained cooperative guidance law. It is shown that the proposedguidance law is superior to the optimal control based cooperative guidance law when thetarget is unpredictable and that the interceptors¡¯ acceleration requirements are comparableto conventional guidance laws, that do not impose an angular constraint at interception.","A Cooperative Di?erential Game"

This project will studyice accretion that may occur on small unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS) under possibleoperational envelopes. The goal is to characterize the conditions in which create ice accre-tions on UAS and to map the icing structure. A system is under development that is ableto seek out and examine icing conditions in-ight, including standard in-cloud icing as wellas the more dangerous SLD conditions. Careful path planning will be required to y andcollect data in the desired conditions to both locate icing conditions and avoid potentialhazards.

3316,AIAA-2017-0581,Modelling wing wake and tail-wake interaction of a clap-and-peel flapping-wing MAV,"While tailless flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle designs are attracting significant in-terest, the tailed option offers many benefits, such as static stability and simpler controlstrategy, which separates the wing control from the tail control. However, the interactionbetween wing wake and tail is complex, due to the unsteady, time-varying wing aerodynam-ics, and is generally not modelled explicitly. We propose an approach to model the wingwake and wake-tail interaction in a tail-equipped flapping-wing robot. First, the wake ismodelled as a periodic function depending on wing flap phase and position with respect tothe wings. The overall model is constructed out of six low-order sub-models representingthe mean, amplitude and phase of the velocity components considered. The parametersin each sub-model are estimated from PIV measurements using an identification methodbased on multivariate simplex splines. The computed model represents the measured wakewith high accuracy, while being computationally manageable, and can be applied to dif-ferent tail geometries within the range covered by the data. The wake model is then usedwithin a standard aerodynamic force model, and combined with the effect of free-streamvelocity, to estimate the forces produced by the tail. The obtained results provide a basisfor further modelling and simulation work, and additionally yield insight into the role ofthe tail and its interaction with the wings in flapping-wing vehicles.","Modelling wing wake and tail-wake interaction of a"

The growing wealth of many countries goes along with a substantial increase in travel needs. Global market forecasts foresee the total number of airline passengers to double within the next 20 years. Accommodating this air traffic growth is highly challenging for many airports around the world, as by now they are already facing substantial capacity constraints. Necessary airport infrastructure expansion projects cannot be realized in many cases. Therefore, a more efficient utilization of the existing infrastructure is regarded as one of the key enablers for future air traffic growth. Within this study five different airport capacity optimization measures will be analyzed by using a comparative evaluation model. The investigations of 22 international hub airports revealed that these measures can significantly contribute to an alleviation of the future congestion situation. In the best case scenario, average capacity utilization can be reduced by 48% for the year 2031, compared to the baseline scenario. However, even in this case, a relevant share of the air traffic growth cannot be accommodated. In that case, the feasibility of new airport construction projects would be highly valuable if integrated into such an analysis even though a very high uncertainty is associated with it.","

The air traffic stream bound for Tokyo from west area is usually subject to air traffic control for time separation in a specific air sector near the terminal area. The accuracy improvement of such the airborne delay prediction is expected to enable the efficient determination of the ground delay time to minimize the airborne delay. In this study the feasibility of prediction using the pre-departure information, e.g. weather forecast and the predicted trajectory, is investigated. Though the queueing analysis is able to predict the delay variation, it is unable to predict the average accurately. In contrast, the artificial neural network is able to the average delay exactly while it is unable to predict the steep increase of delay around the congestion time zone. The delay is essentially autoregressive because it strongly depends on the preceding aircraft¡¯s one. It is clarified that a neural network including the autoregressive property is able to predict exactly both the drastic delay increase and the average value.","Prediction of Delay due to Air Traffic Control by Machine "

These stateestimation algorithms are based on tracked feature points and the homography relationshipthat relates the camera motion to the locations of tracked planar feature points in the imageplane. An extended Kalman filter implementation is developed to perform sensor fusion usingmeasurements from an onboard inertial measurement unit (accelerometers and rate gyros)with vision-based measurements derived from the homography relationship. Therefore, themeasurement update in the filter requires the processing of images from a monocular camerato detect and track planar feature points followed by the computation of homographyparameters. The state estimation algorithms are designed to be independent of GPS sinceGPS can be unreliable or unavailable in many operational environments of interest such asurban environments.

3323,AIAA-2017-0674,Vision Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Landing,"THIS paper describes a vision-based algorithm for autonomous landing on a moving target. The algorithmfuses multiple outputs of two different computer vision techniques. One is the Viola-Jones object detectionusing Haar-like features, and the other is the AprilTag detection that segments an image based on local gradients.The Haar-like feature detector can detect any arbitrary known features, and we use this method whenan aircraft is at altitude and approaches a landing spot. The AprilTag, which allows for precise position andattitude determination of the target, is placed at an expected landing location and used for a final approach.The combination of those techniques allows us to track the target through all the landing phases from altitudeto touch down. We fuse the outputs by utilizing the statistics of the measurements and multiple extendedKalman filters. This way, we can not only probabilistically choose the right target from multiple candidatesbut also estimate the velocity of the target for formation flight and landing. This algorithm is demonstrated inan image-in-the-loop simulation and flight tests with a Yamaha RMAX helicopter and aWAM-V boat.","Vision Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Landing"

Initially, the scenarios is classi ed into the in-the-air scenario and near-the-ground scenario based on a horizon detector.Then di erent obstacle detection andavoidance maneuver methods are adopted. For the near-the-ground scenario, a 3D recon-struction based detection method and a virtual obstacle plane based collision avoid methodare adopted to sense and avoid the static obstacles on the ground.

3331,AIAA-2017-0365,Improved Neumann Expansion Method Using Partial Bivariate Subspaces,"A preliminary approach to determine the optimum partial set of bivariate subspaces forthe improved Neumann expansion method is presented in this study. The improvedNeumann expansion method is developed for the evaluations of statistical moments of afinite element system under stochastic uncertainties in system properties and operationalenvironments. The existing univariate decomposition method is highly efficient toapproximate the multidimensional integration by ignoring all the interaction effects, whichoften leads to a huge error. To capture the interaction effects, the bivariate or high orderdecomposition approaches can be used. However, the computational costs of thedecomposition methods usually become prohibitive, especially for a design study. To addressthe technical challenges, the improved Neumann expansion method is developed for anefficient and accurate stochastic uncertainty quantification. The basic ingredients of theimproved Neumann expansion method are the successive matrix inversion and partialbivariate dimension reduction methods. The successive matrix inversion computes an exactrealization of a stochastic system response for locally affecting randomness in an efficientmanner. Also, multidimensional probability integration is approximated by considering apartial set of bivariate subspaces to improve the estimation accuracy by capturingsignificant interaction effects with a marginal increase in computational cost. One of the keyquestions for the proposed improved Neumann expansion method is how to determine theoptimum partial set of bivariate subspaces.","Improved Neumann Expansion Method  "

Lift over-prediction (5 ? 10% around(l=d)max) in RFOIL (similarly in XFOIL) is observed for thick airfoils for a wide range ofangles of attack. The lift slope is over-predicted resulting in the increasing error in liftwith increasing angle of attack. The wake geometry in RFOIL and XFOIL is determinedfrom the inviscid calculations which seems to give rise to the above problem. A schemehas been developed for IBL methods and implemented in RFOIL, to include the e ects ofviscous ow on the wake geometry which lead to improved lift prediction for thick airfoils.New insights were obtained regarding the discrepancy in predicting the maximum lift.

The results obtained by ANSYS multiphysics solvers CFX and Fluent compare well with experiments of the Benchmark Supercritical Wing (BSCW) for steady wing pressure coefficient and unsteady pressure frequency response function (FRF). A slight sensitivity in pressure coefficient with grid refinement was observed on the suction surface just downstream of the leading edge. To accurately capture the suction peak pressure coefficient further grid refinement is recommended. BSCW simulations performed at experimental on-set flutter dynamic pressure using ANSYS CFX show good agreement with experimentally measured flutter frequency and pressure coefficient magnitude and phase. The on-set wing flutter is predicted at a lower dynamic pressure than the experimental on-set flutter dynamic pressure.," Aeroelastic Simulations Using ANSYS Multiphysics "

Without means for aeroelastic compensation,the benefit of weight reduction from the use of light-weight material could be offset by less optimalaerodynamic performance at off-design flight conditions.

3347,AIAA-2017-1987,Buckling and Vibration Analysis of Long Rectangular Composite Plates,"Application of composite structures has been increasing in aerospace engineering due to their high stiffness, light weight and their high corrosion resistance. Analysis of these structures using approximation methods, such as the Rayleigh¡¯s or Rayleigh-Ritz method, can be used to efficiently predict stability and modal responses to buckling and vibration. In contrast to more extensive approaches like the finite element method, Rayleigh-Ritz method, which is based on the total potential energy formulation, can rapidly predict structural responses and can be easily integrated into optimization schemes. The authors herein present a series of expressions for the fast determination of the stability and vibrational response of long, semi-infinite, thin composite strips. These energy based analytical tools can be used to find critical buckling loads and predict mode shapes and natural frequencies of such structures. The present study follows that of Kassapoglou¡¯s and Thielmann¡¯s previous investigation for the shear buckling of semi-infinite isotropic plates. However, for the vibrational analysis, the choice of the admissible functions are different. A computer program utilizing Rayleigh¡¯s method is developed to find solutions to determine eigenvalues associated with the stability and vibrational response. The displacements of the semi-infinite plate are modeled using Kirchhoff plate theory. The author¡¯s show how the plate¡¯s aspect ratio mater affect the critical buckling loads and natural frequencies of the structure. The Commercial finite element software (MSC.Nastran/Patran) is used to verify results obtained from the Rayleigh¡¯s method.","

3350,AIAA-2017-0206,Honeycomb Core Buckling Due to Transverse Compression,"The paper presents the results of an investigation on honeycomb core buckling due to transverse compression. Both linear and nonlinear buckling analyses were performed to investigate the differences between using a one cell representative volume element and a multi-cell representative volume element to characterize the behavior under transverse compression of the core. The linear buckling analysis was performed for 1/8¡å cell size for four different core densities and four different core thicknesses; starting at 0.25¡å and increasing it in 0.25¡å increments up to 1.00¡å core thickness. Nonlinear buckling analysis using elastic perfectly-plastic model with imperfections is performed for 1/8¡å cell size with 3.1 pcf core density and 0.50¡å core thickness. An assessment of the degradation in the equivalent properties of the honeycomb core when damaged under the action of transverse compression was performed by analyzing the deformed shape resulting from the nonlinear buckling analysis. The linear buckling analysis shows that the core critical buckling load capacity decreases by 6% as the core thickness increases from 0.25¡å to 0.50¡å and an additional 1% ¨C 2% at higher core thicknesses up to 1.00¡å. The linear buckling analysis also shows that the single-cell representative volume element slightly under-predicts the compressive buckling load when compared to the multi-cell volume element. Additionally, the single-cell volume element incorrectly predicts the buckling mode for the 1.00¡å core thickness with high core density.","Honeycomb Core Buckling Due to Transverse Compression "

Since strain variables are independent degrees of the beam formulation, the displacement constraints between the main wings and bracing members are considered using Lagrange multipliers. The complete equations of motion are derived by following Hamilton¡¯s Principle and discretized into constant-strain elements. The strain-based aeroelastic formulation with the inter-member displacement constraints is flexible and allows to model and analyze arbitrary aircraft platforms.

Curved panels are susceptible to dynamic snap-through when subjected to high amplitudeloading. In order to properly model the statistical response of these structures to the random loadingenvironment, the response must be computed over a long time window. This can be done using the fullorder nonlinear  nite element (FE) model but is computationally expensive due to the large number ofequations that must be solved at every time step. This is time consuming even on modern computingclusters, and this drastically limits design and analysis cycles of the vehicles.

The wings experimentallytested constitute two categories, traditional trailing edge mounted aileron aps, and wingtip mounted articulated winglets which hinge chordwise. Low-aspect-ratio (LAR) wings atlow-Reynolds numbers were chosen because these parameters are common to micro aerialvehicle (MAV) ight. Control authority developed by the control surface con gurationswere directly compared by measuring lateral forces and speci cally the roll moment inwind tunnel testing. Flat plate wing models were studied to isolate the low aspect ratioaerodynamics from more complicated wing geometry e ects. The manipulation of wingtip vortices' (TV) by articulated winglets is found to be an e ective method of generatingroll, especially in sideslip situations. We see conventional aps generate a predictable rollmoment varying slightly with angle of attack while articulated winglets rely on alteringthe span-wise distribution of lift. It is seen that in the delayed stall region, unique to LARand delta wing ight, winglets generate the same authority as traditional aps and developgreater authority in sideslip situations.","Manipulation of ?ow structures on low aspect ratio"

When the target is lost during tracking,a nonlinear likelihood function with specific properties is constructed using a priori mapinformation and is approximated by the Gaussian sum, from which the approximated esti-mation mean and covariance can be obtained using Bayes rule. The proposed approximatedestimation uniformly converges to the target probability density as the number of termsin the Gaussian sum grows; and it smoothly switches to the standard Kalman filter oncethe target is detected, if a linear target motion model is applied. An illustrative numericalexample demonstrates that the proposed approach is less computationally expensive andmore reliable compared with currently used grid-based recursive Bayesian estimation.","Gaussian Sum-based Maneuvering Target Tracking"

This offers designers the ability to tailor response types via various flight control modes to specific missions or flight conditions. The mode transitions, envelope limiting, and control surface rate and position saturation that can accompany fly-by-wire designs may lead to pilot-vehicle system loss of control in the form of pilot-induced oscillations (PIO). With most fly-by-wire designs, the PIO tendencies have surfaced in flight test allowing for modifications that can reduce these tendencies. While predictive PIO metrics are available, though more work in this area is still needed, control room monitoring metrics have not been widely used. This paper explores the use of a wavelet scalogram-based metric that considers the time-varying peak pilot input power as a function of the controlled element phase at the frequency of the peak power, all of which are elements of the previously defined PIO signature. A flight test database generated in the evaluation of the Smart-Cue/Smart-Gain PIO mitigation concept is used to assess the utility of the proposed approach.

Since utterinvolves large pitch angle oscillations, an appropriate limit cycle oscillations suppressionrequires to schedule the controller gains with this system variable. The main concernwith this approach lies in the fact that using endogenous signals as scheduling parameterswill introduce hidden coupling terms in the linearized gain-scheduled controller dynamics,which may result in performance degradation and instability of the closed-loop system.The procedure adopted in this paper handles these hidden coupling terms via a structuredH1 design. Speci cally, this approach guarantees that the resulting nonlinear closed-loopsystem fully complies with the controller design in the sense that the linearization of theclosed-loop nonlinear model coincides at each operating point with the closed-loop linearsystem used in the design.

More advanced research investigated the thrust controller whileignoring the acceleration controller (Goddard problem) or the pulse motorproblem focusing on finding the time between the pulses and theirmagnitude, thus obtaining sub-optimal performances. The real problem forvarious optimization objectives (maximum velocity, minimum time andminimum acceleration effort) including atmospheric flight and defining thethrust and acceleration commands as two controllers wasn't investigated. Inthe first part of this research while using Kelly's approach for SingularOptimal Control the optimal thrust controller was developed analytically forthe 2D Goddard problem. Next, the 2D non linear problem was solved usingoptimal control theory defining the thrust and acceleration commands as twocontrollers and assuming atmospheric flight. The solution is shown forvarious optimization criteria and emphasizes the characterization of theoptimal thrust command for each case. In the second part, the solution isextended for the Multiple Objective Optimization Problem. By implementingthe Pareto-Set principle to optimal control theory the curve including alloptimal solutions is obtained. The conclusions derived from this researchmay be used in practice and may helpful when designing an optimal boundedpropellant engine for various tasks.","Optimal Guidance with Additional Thrust Controller for Various Flight Tasks "
3382,AIAA-2017-1897,Synopsis of Precision Landing and Hazard Avoidance (PL&HA) Capabilities for Space Exploration,"Robotic exploration missions to the Moon, Mars, and other solar system bodies havehistorically relied upon controlled blind landings. Because terrestrial techniques for terrainrelative navigation (TRN) had not yet been evolved to support space exploration, landingdispersions were driven by the capabilities of inertial navigation systems combined withsurface relative altimetry and velocimetry. Lacking tight control over the actual landinglocation, mission success depended on the statistical vetting of candidate landing areas withinthe predicted landing dispersion ellipse based on orbital reconnaissance data, combined withthe ability of the spacecraft to execute a controlled landing in terms of touchdown attitude,attitude rates, and velocity. In addition, the sensors, algorithms, and processing technologiesrequired to perform autonomous hazard detection and avoidance in real time during thelanding sequence were not yet available. Over the past decade, NASA has invested substantialresources on the development, integration, and testing of autonomous precision landing andhazard avoidance (PL&HA) capabilities. In addition to substantially improving landingaccuracy and safety, these autonomous PL&HA functions also offer access to targets ofinterest located within more rugged and hazardous terrain. Optical TRN systems arebaselined on upcoming robotic landing missions to the Moon and Mars, and NASA recentlyfunded a Europa lander study that plans to incorporate a comprehensive PL&HA system.These robotic missions will demonstrate and mature PL&HA technologies that are consideredessential for future human exploration missions. PL&HA technologies also have applicationsto rendezvous and docking/berthing with other spacecraft, as well as proximity navigation,contact, and retrieval missions to smaller bodies with microgravity environments, such asasteroids.","Synopsis of Precision Landing and Hazard Avoidance "
3383,AIAA-2017-1898,"A Rigid Mid Lift-to-Drag Ratio Approach to Human Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing","Current NASA Human Mars architectures require delivery of approximately 20 metric tons of cargo to the surface in a single landing. A proposed vehicle type for performing the entry, descent, and landing at Mars associated with this architecture is a rigid, enclosed, elongated lifting body shape that provides a higher lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) than a typical entry capsule, but lower than a typical winged entry vehicle (such as the Space Shuttle Orbiter). A rigid Mid-L/D shape has advantages for large mass Mars EDL, including loads management, range capability during entry, and human spaceflight heritage. Previous large mass Mars studies have focused more on symmetric and/or circular cross-section Mid-L/D shapes such as the ellipsled. More recent work has shown performance advantages for non-circular cross section shapes. This paper will describe efforts to design a rigid Mid-L/D entry vehicle for Mars which shows mass and performance improvements over previous Mid-L/D studies. The proposed concept, work to date and evolution, forward path, and suggested future strategy are described.","A Rigid Mid-Lift-to-Drag Ratio Approach to Human Mars "

The experimental study was conducted in the Icing Research Tunnel of Iowa State University (ISU-IRT). Six test cases with three typical liquid water content (LWC) levels (i.e., LWC =0.3 g/m3, 1.1 g/m3, and 3.0 g/m3) and two typical incoming airflow temperatures (i.e., T¡Þ = -5 oC, and -10 oC) were selected to represent rime icing, mixed icing and glaze icing conditions that wind turbines may experience in winter. In addition to using a high-speed imaging system to qunatify the transient behavior of surface water runback and dynamic ice accretion processes over the airfoil surface, an infrared (IR) thermal imaging system was also ultilized to simultaneously measure the airfoil surface temperature distributions in the course of the ice accreting process. The measurement results reveal clearly that, both the length of the surface water/ice film formed near the airfoil leading edge and the subsequent water/ice rivulet length would increase as the liquid water content level and the temperature of the incoming airflow increase. The thickness of the ice accreted at the airfoil leading edge was found to grow rapidly with the increasing liquid water content level and descreasing incoming airflow temperature for both glaze and mixed icing test cases. The temperature distribution over the airfoil surface was also found to vary significantly, depending on the ice type of accreted over the airfoil surface. A chordwise ¡®plateau¡¯ region was observed in the measured surface temperature distributions for the glaze icing cases, due to the formation of surafce water runback over the ice accreting airfoil surface.","An Experimental Study on Icing Physics for Wind Turbine "

To further complicate matters,in many applications it is critical to accurately approximate the \risk"" associated with thestatistical tails of the system responses, not just the statistical moments. In this paper, wedevelop an adaptive sampling and local reduced basis method for approximately solvingPDEs with random inputs. Our method determines a set of parameter atoms and an associ-ated (implicit) Voronoi partition of the parameter domain on which we build local reducedbasis approximations of the PDE solution. In addition, we extend our adaptive samplingapproach to accurately compute measures of risk evaluated at quantities of interest thatdepend on the PDE solution.

3388,AIAA-2017-2003,Unsteady Interacting Boundary Layer Method,"Within this study an unsteady, two-dimensional interacting boundary layer method ispresented for the incompressible ow around wind turbine rotor blade sections. The mainapproach is to divide the ow  eld in to two regions; the one in the vicinity of the sur-face where the viscosity is e ective (so called boundary layer) and the one away from thesurface where the ow can be assumed as inviscid. The solutions obtained from these tworegions are matched with a quasi-simultaneous viscous-inviscid interaction scheme. For theviscous ow, unsteady integral boundary layer equations together with laminar and turbu-lent closure sets are solved employing a high-order quadrature-free discontinuous Galerkinmethod. Laminar to turbulent transition is modeled with the eN method. The potentialow is solved by using the linear-strength vortex panel method. It is shown that intro-ducing the interaction scheme leads to non-conservative mechanisms in the system. Thediscontinuous Galerkin method is extended to handle these non-conservative ux terms.Furthermore it is shown that this numerical method achieves the designed order of ac-curacy for smooth problems. Results are presented for the individual numerical solutionmethods which are veri ed on various test cases and subsequently for the coupled systemwhich is applied on a chosen test case. Evaluation of a laminar ow over an airfoil sectionis shown and the results (converged to a steady state solution) are compared with othernumerical solutions as well as with the experimental data where available. It is shown thatthe results of the developed numerical solution method are in good agreement with theexperimental data and other computational methods.","Unsteady Interacting Boundary Layer Method"

Of the variety of possible parametric representations for airfoil shapes, basisexpansion interpretations allow for easy manipulation and adaptation of any proposed pa-rameterization. Furthermore, we discuss how basis expansion parameterizations can berelated to physically relevant airfoil quantities. Consequently, by incorporating active sub-spaces it is possible to identify reduced dimension approximations of engineering quantitiesof interest that can be related to physical airfoil shape quantities.

The present day techniques for accurate pipe strengthdetermination encounter several gaps in terms of single modality measurements anduncertainties. In view of this, the present study focuses on the design of a novel informationfusion framework using multimodality diagnosis for pipe materials to predict the accurateprobabilistic strength and toughness estimation under uncertainties. The mechanicalproperty variation such as strength/fracture toughness is assessed in terms of a number ofmaterial properties such as chemical composition, microstructure, dislocation density etc.,with the use of several in-situ and ex-situ experiments. Advanced data analysis usingGaussian Processing model will be performed for surrogate modeling and uncertaintyquantification. Simulation and prototype testing will be carried out for model validation anddemonstration. Probabilistic pipe strength and toughness estimation is inferred based on theposterior distribution after information fusion. Inhomogeneity in the material properties isstudied with several through thickness studies, to account for the mechanical propertyvariation from surface to bulk. Finally, a microstructure-property based 3-D stochasticreconstruction model will be used to serve as an integrated computational framework forprediction of probablisitic strength.

Several sources of uncertainty may impact the performance of an engi-neering device through operative conditions, manufacturing tolerances, and even physicalmodels. In the presence of multiphysics systems the number of the uncertain parameterscan be fairly large and their propagation through the numerical codes still remains pro-hibitive because the overall computational budget often allows for only an handful of suchhigh-fidelity realizations. On the other side, common engineering practice can take advan-tage from a solid history of development and assessment of so called low-fidelity modelswhich albeit less accurate are often capable to at least capture overall trends and param-eter dependencies of the system. In this contribution we address the forward propagationof uncertainty parameters relying on statistical estimators built on sequences of numericaland physical discretizations which are provably convergent to the high-fidelity statistics,while exploiting low-fidelity computational models to increase the reliability and confidencein the numerical predictions. The performances of the approaches are presented by meansof two fairly complicated aerospace problems, namely the aero-thermo-structural analysisof a turbofan engine nozzle and a flow through a scramjet-like device.","A multi?delity multilevel Monte Carlo method for"

A multi-objective optimization of maximizing mean NPP and minimizing uncertainty of the satellite system produces a pareto front of design options. Expected utility theory is then applied to determine the most preferred designs along the pareto front given an individual¡¯s risk preference. Optimizing to minimize uncertainty, however, requires a metric with which to quantify uncertainty.

In orderto be effective, such guidance should enhance the pilot¡¯s ability to execute the FederalAviation Administration¡¯s recommended stall recovery procedure. This paper exploresthe use of a fast model predictive control algorithm that determines near optimal recov-ery guidance, which quantifies the aircraft configuration and situation dependent recoveryinformation required to maximize the effectiveness of the recovery. This information in-cludes the magnitude of the initial pitch down maneuver, the specific amount of airspeedand thrust needed before pulling out of the recovery dive, as well as the maximum pitch-uprate that can be sustained without causing a secondary stall. The algorithm was integratedand tested with an in-house desktop simulator that implements the General Transport Air-craft model and the associated stall aircraft dynamics. Preliminary results are presentedto demonstrate the use of the proposed approach as a recovery aid for pilots.","Stall Recovery Guidance Using"

A trilaterationbased estimation problem is solved every time a particular member of the team obtainssu cient measurements (from the team). During the time intervals when the trilaterationproblem cannot be solved, each vehicle in range propagates a target model and utilizes anextended Kalman  lter to continuously estimate the target location. Since the vehicles havelimited range sensing capability, the target is not available to all team members at all times.A dynamic connection topology establishes the time varying inter-vehicle communication.Vehicles are assumed to be able to communicate their own Inertial position as well as therange to target, if available.

High precision maneuvers such as object pickup/dropo  are typically performed byrotorcraft UAVs, but a successful  xed-wing concept would greatly increase the possiblerange for this type of operation and enable missions into more remote locations. Circularlytowed cable-body systems have been shown capable, both analytically and experimentally,of maintaining stable con gurations with the towed endbody maintaining a small motionrespective to a point on the ground. However, no known e orts consider small to mediumscale UAV operations for object pickup/dropo /manipulation.

An interesting way to achieve fuel reduction is to develop algorithms able to provide the most economical trajectory of reference. This alternative brings as a result the most economical flight in terms of fuel burn without the need of performing any structural modification to the aircraft. In this paper such an algorithm was developed inspired in the Dijkstra¡¯s algorithm in a weight dynamic graph. The algorithm simultaneously optimizes the lateral and the vertical trajectories of reference. The search space was modeled as a graph where the weather information was dynamically obtained for each waypoint. The aircraft performance was modeled under the form of a numerical database obtained using experimental flight data.

Empirical models are typically constructed based on experimental observations, and their material parameters are calibrated by fitting experimental data. Although empirical models do not provide rigorous physical insight into the creep responses of materials, they are practical in structural design applications since they are expressed in simple mathematical functions and do not require massive calculations. Creep responses of Copper alloy NARloy-Z and Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V are analyzed in this study by using empirical approach. Deformation-mechanism maps are used to predict their creep behaviors at various stresses and temperatures, and determine the design spaces based on their creep responses.

Aero-dynamic surfaces were modelled using the Modi ed Strip Theory (MST) approach and astate-space representation of the Leishmann-Beddoes unsteady aerodynamics model. Amodal approach allows the analysis of structural exibility and each mode's inuence onstructural deections. The derivation of equations of motion that provide a new approachto modelling exible aircraft is presented. This takes into account the variations in massand inertia properties due to structural deformations. The AX-1 generic large transportaircraft model is analysed as an example of the CA2LM framework capabilities. Resultsshow that according to the Gibson Dropback Criterion longitudinal handling qualities ofthe AX-1 with no ight control system are unsatisfactory. The analysis of the structuralstiffness inuence shows that increasing exibility of an aircraft structure deteriorates thelongitudinal handling qualities. The short-period damping ratio is within Level 2 accept-ability requirements. In contrast, the short-period frequency and acceleration sensitivitygraph shows that the AX-1 model handling qualities are within Level 1 acceptability re-quirements.

However, over the past decade, the potential of GPSjamming or even spoo ng GPS signals has focused the research community on the develop-ment of GPS-denied navigation technologies. Of the GPS-denied techniques, one approachthat has been considered is the use of a Vehicle Dynamic Models (VDM) to reduce therate at which an INS becomes unusable. As such, this paper considers the use of an aero-dynamic model to aid in compensation of IMU errors of a  xed-wing Unmanned AerialVehicle (UAV). The goals of this paper are to evaluate the sensitivity of the performanceof dynamic model aided navigation in the context of low-cost platforms where performancebene t must be weighed against the complexity that is required to develop the dynamicmodel.

The proposed methodology is based on using  rst-principles for analyzing themotion of the aircraft and estimating its future trajectory. Since the core of this problemlies in predicting the future behavior of a generic aircraft, it is essential to understand thatit is almost impossible to precisely predict the future trajectory with certainty. Hence, anintuitive approach is to analyze the various sources of uncertainty that a ect the aircraftprediction and quantify their combined e ect on the whole trajectory. Further, this paperimplements a global sensitivity analysis-based methodology to quantify the relative contri-butions of the various sources of uncertainty to the uncertainty of the overall trajectory.The proposed methodology is illustrated using a numerical example consisting of an aircraftthat takes o  from the San Francisco International Airport.","Uncertainty Quanti?cation in Tra jectory Prediction"

Investigating the cross-axis sensitivity andinput axis misalignment characteristics are critical when considering the unit¡¯s role as a basis for an inertialreference system, or for providing the feedback in a flight control system. Standard multi-position androtation tests commonly employed for the typical Inertial Measurement Unit that consist of gyroscopes andlinear accelerometers are not applicable for angular accelerometers; oscillatory input is more appropriate forthis type of sensor instead. This paper uses spectral component analysis to inspect both cross-axis sensitivityand input axis misalignment aspects.

3441,AIAA-2017-0922,Optimized Generator Designs for the DTU 10-MW Offshore Wind Turbine using GeneratorSE,"Compared to land-based applications, offshore wind imposes challenges for the development of next generation wind turbine generator technology. Direct-drive generators are believed to offer high availability, efficiency, and reduced operation and maintenance requirements; however, previous research suggests difficulties in scaling to several megawatts or more in size. The resulting designs are excessively large and/or massive, which are major impediments to transportation logistics, especially for offshore applications. At the same time, geared wind turbines continue to sustain offshore market growth through relatively cheaper and lightweight generators. However, reliability issues associated with mechanical components in a geared system create significant operation and maintenance costs, and these costs make up a large portion of overall system costs offshore. Thus, direct-drive turbines are likely to outnumber their gear-driven counterparts for this market, and there is a need to review the costs or opportunities of building machines with different types of generators and examining their competitiveness at the sizes necessary for the next generation of offshore wind turbines. In this paper, we use GeneratorSE, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory¡¯s newly developed systems engineering generator sizing tool to estimate mass, efficiency, and the costs of different generator technologies satisfying the electromagnetic, structural, and basic thermal design requirements for application in a very large-scale offshore wind turbine such as the Technical University of Denmark¡¯s (DTU) 10-MW reference wind turbine. For the DTU reference wind turbine, we use the previously mentioned criteria to optimize a direct-drive, radial flux, permanent-magnet synchronous generator; a direct-drive electrically excited synchronous generator; a medium-speed permanent-magnet generator; and a high-speed, doubly-fed induction generator. Preliminary analysis of leveled costs of energy indicate that for large turbines, the cost of permanent magnets and reliability issues associated with brushes in electrically excited machines are the biggest deterrents for building direct-drive systems. The advantage of medium-speed permanent-magnet machines over doubly-fed induction generators is evident, yet, variability in magnet prices and solutions to address reliability issues associated with gearing and brushes can change this outlook. This suggests the need to potentially pursue fundamentally new innovations in generator designs that help avoid high capital costs but still have significant reliability related to performance.","

It isshown that the temperature difference between the bright and dark colored top wingsurface is around 10 degrees Celsius. The dark color on the top of the wing increases thetemperature of the boundary layer over the wing which consequently reduces the dragforces over the wing.

The model predictions are then compared with those measured experimentally. The CNFs are modeled as a composite of conductive graphitic domains distributed in non-conductive amorphous carbon matrix. The simulated microstructure of CNF/CNTs is generated by growing non-penetrable particle with random initial position and orientation angle, representing the highly ordered graphitic phase in CNF/CNTs. Electrical resistance of hybrid structure is calculated based on the formed conductive network composed of intra-particle resistances and inter-particle resistances. Particle strain distribution with 0.5 % global strain is obtained by applying FEA method. Piezoresistivity of the hybrid CNF/CNTs is calculated through using electrical resistances of the deformed geometry of hybrid structure under global strain. The results point to the significant influence of conductive particle volume fraction on the overall piezoresistivity of whole nanofiber, due to the changed contribution of inter-particle tunneling resistance to overall resistance. The simulation elucidates the microstructure-piezoresistivity relationship in the hybrid nanofiber, which provides a clear path for further improving piezoresistivity of CNF/CNTs hybrid nanofiber through controlling its fabrication process.","

The information gainfrom a future inspection is quantified by a divergence metric, which measures the cracksize distribution before and after incorporating the inspection data. We use a dynamicBayesian network (DBN) to track and predict the fatigue crack growth of aging aircrafts,and to update the crack size distribution when inspection data are available. The mostlikely outcome/data from future inspections are also estimated in DBN. Here we chooseDBN because it is capable of integrating heterogeneous sources of information to accu-rately quantify uncertainty, and offers support for real-time decision making in diagnosticsand prognostics. The proposed approach is demonstrated in a numerical example, wherewe identify the optimal future inspection schedule and the number of repetitive crackdetections during one inspection, which maximize information gain per dollar.","Information gain-based inspection scheduling for"
3448,AIAA-2017-1566,A dynamic Bayesian network approach for digital twin,"Aircraft structural health status varies from one aircraft to another due to the variability in manufacturing, material properties, mission history, pilot variability, etc. This paper uses the concept of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) to build a health monitoring model for diagnosis and prognosis of each individual aircraft, and illustrates the proposed method by an aircraft wing fatigue crack growth example. In diagnosis, the DBN is utilized to track the evolution of the time-dependent variables (dynamic nodes) and calibrate the time-independent variables (static nodes); in prognosis, the DBN is used for probabilistic prediction of crack growth in future loading time steps. By using particle filtering as the Bayesian inference algorithm for the DBN, the proposed approach handles both discrete and continuous variables of various distribution types, and non-linear relationships between nodes. Challenges in implementing the particle filter in DBN where 1) both dynamic and static nodes exist, and 2) a state variable may have parent nodes across two adjacent Bayesian networks, are also resolved.","
3449,AIAA-2017-1567,Probabilistic Damage Tolerance for Aviation Fleets Using a Kriging Surrogate Model,"The damage tolerance analysis (DTA) approach using fatigue crack growth has been thepredominant tool for new aircraft design around the world for the last two decades. However,for aging aircraft it is often necessary to evaluate a field event such as a cracked structure todetermine necessary fleet safety actions such as inspections, modifications, or when to retire apart or airframe. These evaluations require assessing variations in loading, material, andgeometry; therefore, a comprehensive probabilistic damage tolerance analysis (PDTA) willenable airworthiness authorities and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) engineers toconduct risk assessments of aircraft structural issues in support of safety decisions. A PDTAapproach provides also to the Airframe Digital Twin (ADT) a mechanism whereby inspectionand maintenance operations can be included in the simulation, thus providing engineers thecapability to assess the benefits and safety risks of different maintenance actions.Probabilistic damage tolerance analysis involves mathematically intense models andcomputational expensive simulations, which makes these analyses challenging. In this workthe computational expense is reduced using an error based adaptive surrogate model; thesurrogate model can include any number of random variables. The surrogate model will beused as a substitution for the crack growth model for the probabilistic calculations. Twoexample problems are presented to demonstrate the methodology.","Probabilistic Damage Tolerance for Aviation Fleets Using a Kriging "

This was accomplished by subjectingthe frames to three different load rates (4.05 MPa/s, 5.066 MPa/s, and 8.106 MPa/s) as wellas two different boundary conditions for a total of six different load cases. Abaqus FiniteElement (FE) software was used to develop a 0.3048m diameter model of each frameassuming a weight-to-buoancy (W/B) ratio of 0.9 and material properties of Beryllium. ThisFE model will later be used to analyze th dynamic properties (eigenvalues and eigenvectors)of the two frames.

3458,AIAA-2017-0657,An Integrated Crack Initiation and Propagation Module for Fatigue Damage Prediction of Composite Structures,"The present fatigue damage characterization of composite structures is still dominated by the use of a phenomenological stress-life (S-N) approach due to the availability of extensive S-N data and lower cost in generation of S-N data from fatigue tests at different applied stress ratios. Because of the presence of fabrication and service induced defects and sharp geometry features, the resulting intensified stress at hot spots may render the S-N approach inaccurate. A fracture mechanics approach based on a Paris type crack growth law is more rational to compute the crack propagation life based on the driving force evaluated along its evolving front. In order to bridge the gap between the crack initiation and propagation, a unified fatigue initiation and propagation module is developed for a delamination crack. Different from a cohesive model where a non-linear cohesive constituent law is used, distributed nodal springs of linear penalty stiffness are used to extract the energy release rate via the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). A mesh independent crack front description is implemented to define and propagate the delamination front without complying with its existing mesh.","An Integrated Crack Initiation and Propagation Module for "

To accomplish suchmaneuvers, an aircraft must be able to measure the location of nearby aircraft and position itself relative tothese other flight vehicles. In visually degraded environments where vision sensors might struggle, wakesensing provides an effective means of locating other aircraft. Using onboard velocity measurements, wecombine a point-vortex model with a Bayesian filter to estimate a leader aircraft location through the sensingof wingtip wake vortices.

Sandwich panels provide an excellent means to design a stiff structure with significant load carrying capability. The area that is most critical to understanding a sandwich panel¡¯s structural capability is at the locations where the panel connects to other structural members. These locations are known as joints and have to support concentrated loads, which is difficult to do with the very low density sandwich panel. This paper shows that an accurate prediction of honeycomb panel joint capability using a highly-detailed 3-D, nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) is possible. This allows for the potential elimination of coupon testing currently being undertaken early in a spacecraft design program to determine the panel joint capability. A linear FEA model is also able to predict when the initiation of core failure will begin. This, however, has the limitation that the joint will still be able to continue to carry significantly more load prior to its ultimate failure even after the core has begun to buckle. A nonlinear analysis is performed using modified Riks¡¯ method in Abaqus FEA? to show that this failure mode is predictable. The modified Riks¡¯ analysis showed that nonlinear post-buckling analysis of a honeycomb panel coupon can predict ultimate core failure with good accuracy. The solution requires a very high quality mesh in order to continue to run after buckling has begun and requires imperfections based on the linear buckling mode shapes and thickness tolerance on the honeycomb core to be applied.

3489,AIAA-2017-0794,Extracting and Applying Knowledge with Adaptive Knowledge-Driven Optimization to Architect an Earth Observing Satellite System,"Knowledge-driven optimization (KDO) applies machine learning methods during theoptimization to extract design principles that de ne relationships between design variablesthat are common in high-quality designs. In an attempt to accelerate the convergence ofthe optimization, the extracted knowledge is applied during the remainder of the search byencoding it as constraints or knowledge-dependent operators to modify solutions. Applyingthe heuristics as constraints, however, prevents su cient tradespace exploration, which canpotentially lead to convergence on local optimal. In addition, current approaches can onlyapply one knowledge-dependent operator at a time during the optimization process, whichis limiting because some of the learned design principles will be more helpful than others in nding improving solutions. This work presents a new framework KDOnAOS that can gen-erate and apply multiple knowledge-dependent operators during the optimization throughthe use of adaptive operator selection (AOS). KDOnAOS also uses knowledge-independentoperators such as crossover and mutation alongside knowledge-dependent operators andcontinually reallocates computational resources to the e ective operators to maintain ane cient search strategy and escape local optima. The e cacy of KDOnAOS is demon-strated on a design problem where the goal is to architect an Earth observing satellitesystem that maximizes scienti c bene t and minimizes lifecycle cost. The results showthat KDOnAOS statistically outperforms an analogous knowledge-independent algorithmand an algorithm that applies the extracted knowledge through constraints.","Extracting and Applying Knowledge with Adaptive"

Unlike simple terrains, near surface wind experiences high variationin velocity and enhancement of turbulence in the complex terrains. Local measurementin sparse locations is inadequate to assess such diverse wind pro le and application ofnumerical models has the potential to deliver detailed insight. In this work, the Bolundhill experiment, a rigorous complex terrain  eld campaign, is used to validate a Large EddySimulation (LES) model. The LES model applied is available in the SOWFA solver librarydeveloped based on the open-source solver OpenFOAM. A series of precursor LES has beenperformed to bridge the gap between atmospheric macro scale with terrain induced microscale and used as a source of turbulent inow for the Bolund hill LES. The inuence ofturbulent inow is compared with a steady inow LES. The sequential precursor LES foundconsistent in terms of mean velocity and turbulence stresses. Although, minor di erencesfound for mean wind speed, the TKE of the steady inow Bolund hill LES is always under-estimated. The precursor inow fed Bolund hill LES performed well in areas of nearly atterrain and have a few scope of improvements in the di cult ow regions such as steepslope and ridges. Due to computational resource limitation, only two hill LES with di erentturbulent inow for ten minutes each has been performed, which is statistically inadequatecompared to enormous data compiled in the experimental campaign. This study identi edthe importance of turbulent inow for complex terrain LES and established a feasible andoptimal approach to generate turbulent inow through sequential precursor LES.

Thecomplete work ow to investigate LES for the ABL over real complex terrain is describedincluding meteorological-tower data analysis, mesh generation, boundary conditions devel-opment and case set-up. The turbulent inow data are obtained from precursor simulationsand new boundary conditions for the lateral boundaries are developed to replace the pe-riodic boundary conditions which are commonly used in at terrain ABL simulations. Acomparison between a fully periodic and an inow/outow type simulation of a at terrainABL shows good agreement for the mean wind statistics. The top boundary condition isalso improved by enabling su cient inow to prevent ow deceleration behind ridges thatwould occur if using a slip-wall boundary condition. Conditionally averaged meteorolog-ical tower data are used to specify the conditions for a at terrain precursor simulationand also for the comparison with the simulation results of a complex terrain LES. Thesimulation results of the terrain LES are displayed in terms of stream-wise, cross-streamand vertical velocity component contours to show the ow features on the boundaries andnear the complicated terrain shapes. It is observed that boundary layer separation occursdownstream of a prominent ridge which runs across the simulation domain.

Using two different TLGI systems, we visualize crack-like defects in CFRP laminates that were subjected to impact forces up to 9 Joules and subsequent bending tests. Using DFC, we are able to detect cracks in samples that were subjected to low impact forces whereas these defects are merely detectable using AC. Specimens were scanned at isometric voxel sizes between 4.8 ¦Ìm and 22.8 ¦Ìm. TLGI-XCT results are compared to ultrasonic examinations and high resolution XCT scans. Due to the fact that DFC delivers morphological information in the sub-pixel regime depending on the local scattering power, dark field imaging delivers information that may otherwise be inaccessible using conventional XCT. Using a Talbot-Lau XCT we show that dark field images yield a high contrast and a strong signal at interfaces, in particular for matrix cracks and pores.","Non-destructive evaluation of defects in polymer matrix "

The FSMsteers the deviated beam to the desired target. Here, sliding mode control is implemented which operatesunder nominal conditions. Due to ageing, it leads to parametric matched uncertainties of the FSM model. Itdeteriorates the performance of the nominal sliding mode control. Hence, an adaptive controller is designed toretain the desired performance in tracking the reference signal. A reference model is designed using dynamicinversion. Further, an adaptive sliding mode controller (with proportional-integral sliding surface) is designedand implemented on the perturbed system such that it negates the effects of uncertainties to improve the overalltracking performance. This makes the actual (perturbed) model follow the reference model. The proportionalintegralsliding surface proves out to be more robust towards parameter uncertainties.

The in-adequacy operator is developed to address two sources of inadequacy in chemical kineticsfor turbulent combustion. First, the detailed model representing the combustion mecha-nisms may be incomplete due to a lack of knowledge about all relevant chemical pathways.For example, the detailed mechanism may be missing reactions and species. Moreover,many combustion codes work with a reduced reaction set that deliberately neglects certainchemical reactions and species. Second, there is uncertainty surrounding reaction rate pa-rameters in the chemical reactions in both the reduced and detailed models. Our presentformulation builds upon previous work [10] in which a stochastic operator formulation wasdeveloped for combustion kinetics and tested on a perfectly-stirred reactor and on a pre-mixed laminar ame. The current formulation extends and generalizes the previous workby considering temperature dependence, ignition times, and heating rates when buildingthe stochastic operator.

3513,AIAA-2017-1588,A Flutter Suppression and Drag Optimization Approach for Flexible Aircraft,"Wing shaping in flexible aircraft can be enabled using the innovative concept of the variable camber continuous trailing edge flaps (VCCTEF) [1][2]. There are several ongoing NASA efforts related to the design, implementation and wind-tunnel testing of this concept as applied to commercial transport aircraft with flexible wings. While this concept has a great potential to achieve effective drag reduction, the effects of the reduced wing stiffness and VCCTEF on the overall flight control system are still poorly understood. Reduced stiffness may lead to wing flutter and, in addition, displacements of the VCCTEF control surfaces are slow, limited and subject to highly nonlinear and time-varying constraints. Hence the flight control design needs to solve a multi-layered constrained multi-objective optimization problem. To address these challenges, under our current SBIR program, SSCI carried out initial development and testing of the Drag Identification and Reduction Technology (DIRECT). The control strategy implemented under the DIRECT framework decouples the system and suppresses flutter using fast control surfaces, while the slow VCCTEF surfaces are used for drag minimization. In this paper we show how that approach can be used to develop an adaptive controller for the system under parametric uncertainty. We also discuss the use of shaping functions to account for VCCTEF constraints. In the paper we also show the results of a simulation study based on the use of the Evolutionary Algorithm to select optimal controller parameters to achieve on-line drag minimization.","A Flutter Suppression and Drag Optimization Approach for "

Using two small modifiedunmanned air vehicle platforms (UAVs), one with a distributed array of 12 strain gaugesensors and one with a chord-wise array of 4 pressure sensors, we have examined the dis-tribution of the strain and air pressure signals over the UAV wings in relation to flightconditions, including wind tunnel testing, indoor free flight and outdoor free flight. Wehave also characterised the signals provided by controlled gusts and natural turbulence.These sensors were then successfully used to control roll motions in the case of the strainsensor platform and pitch motions in the case of the pressure sensor platform. These resultssuggest that distributed mechanosensing and airflow sensing both offer advantages beyondtraditional flight control based on rigid body state estimation using inertial sensing. Theseadvantages include stall detection, gust alleviation and model-free measurement of aero-dynamic forces. These advantages are likely to be important in the development of futureaircraft with increasing numbers of degrees of freedom both through flexibility and activemorphing.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, January 2017, Grapevine, Texas"

This paper discusses the use of solely aerodynamic drag force to perform this targeting, which is especially useful for smaller spacecraft that do not contain thrusters. It is shown that by varying the ballistic coefficient of a spacecraft over time, any desired longitude and latitude can be targeted provided that the maneuvering begins early enough and the latitude is less than the inclination of the orbit. An analytical solution based on perturbations from a numerically propagated trajectory is developed to estimate the ballistic coefficient profile necessary to reach a given target point assuming small deviations from the numerical trajectory. An iterative process whereby analytical solutions are tested and refined can be utilized to determine the ballistic coefficient necessary for re-entry point targeting. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to validate the algorithm and the desired de-orbit points were reached within a tolerable error in all tested scenarios. The High Precision Orbit Propagator in AGI¡¯s Systems Tool Kit software was also utilized to validate the targeting algorithm.","

The vehicle utilizes two independently driven wings to provide lift andmaneuverability. Wing design and construction is a critical aspect of successfully yingthese types of vehicles. Variations to a wing design, capable of generating su cient lift, aredescribed. All changes to the wing design entail adding or removing carbon  ber to di erentsections of the wing. The e ect is that the sti ness of the wing changes, altering the wing'sin-plane, out-of-plane, and torsional sti ness. Torsional sti ness is particularly importantbecause it e ectively sets the wing's angle of attack. A wing that is too torsionally sti  at aparticular apping frequency will not achieve an optimal angle of attack, resulting in reducedlift and large drag forces. On the other hand, a wing that is not torsionally sti  enough willresult in a small angle of attack and a small drag force. In addition to wing variations andstructural testing, a method is outlined that allows a designer to obtain an initial estimate of the wing geometry required for a vehicle that is a di erent weight than the one used inthis work. This estimate is an extrapolation from a wing used in a successful ight test.Expressions are derived which allow calculation of the wing span and chord along with therequired structural properties for a new wing geometry.","Wing Design and Testing for a Tailless"

High mass missions will likely use supersonic retropropulsion to improve landed mass performance. This work focuses on the characterization of the hypersonic portion of flight for entry, descent, and landing systems using supersonic retropropulsion. Optimal control techniques are used to determine desirable hypersonic bank profiles to achieve favorable supersonic retropropulsion ignition states. Bang-bang bank control is shown to be optimal for objective functions of interest. A clear trade-off between altitude and flight-path angle at supersonic retropropulsion initiation is identified. Minimization of propellant used during powered descent is described and studied parametrically. Results show that ballistic coefficient and lift-to-drag ratio effects largely determine minimum propellant mass fraction; changes to the vehicle state at entry interface have a smaller effect. Reachable supersonic retropropulsion ignition states are presented over a range of vehicle and trajectory parameters of interest. Results indicate ballistic coefficient and lift-to-drag ratio dominate the size and shape of this space and execution of an appropriate hypersonic flight strategy can significantly reduce the amount of propellant required for powered descent and landing.","

The control law evaluated with aircraft model consists of globally nonlinear controller obtained from gain-scheduling of linear controllers. High fidelity aerodynamic model, in the form of lookup tables, is developed from static, coning and oscillatory coning rotary balance wind tunnel tests. Prediction of all attainable steady spin modes is done by solving three degrees-of-freedom aircraft model and influence of high alpha yawing moment asymmetry on spin equilibria shape is analyzed. Numerical simulations of fully developed spins in open-loop and closed-loop configurations are performed to investigate affect of control law on the dynamic characteristics of aircraft spin. It is found that large amplitude oscillations in angle of attack and sideslip, observed in open-loop left and right flat spins, are significantly damped by the control law. The control law also effectively reduces the recovery time of left flat spins; however recovery of right flat oscillatory spins, which exist across the entire range of aileron deflections and for all elevator settings, is not accelerated when control law is employed.","

Dynamic soaring maneuvers have been investigated inthe past for formulating optimized trajectories for powered / unpowered aerial vehicles having fixedplatform configuration. Analysis of soaring bird flight, however, reveals that soaring maneuver isperformed under morphing condition, as the bird rest on its wings with a shoulder lock and skillfullyvaries wing planform and twist. This clearly indicates that a biologically inspired aerial platformwith the capability to morph will best imitate bird flight and will be able to acquire maximum energyfrom the atmosphere by adapting to the most befitting configuration during the maneuver. In thispaper, we are presenting preliminary results of a study for implementing dynamic soaring for amorphing capable UAV which can modify its planform configuration by varying wing sweep. Threedimensionalpoint-mass UAV equations of motion and linear wind gradient profile are used to modelflight dynamics.

Pilots are insufficiently trained to recover from unintended flight attitudes beyond the stall. As a result, the demand to cost-effectively extend flight simulation training devices to wider ranges in angle of attack, sideslip, and bank angles has arisen. State-of-the-art literature is used to develop Ventus, a post-stall geometry-based aerodynamic model that is created in the Matlab Simulink environment. This six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) representative model includes quasi-steady and unsteady aerodynamic coefficients that are determined phenomenologically. Ventus uses airfoil theory which is corrected for 3D effects. Time constants are used to simulate time lag to the down- and upstream airflow. Both chordwise and spanwise, flow separation is included to accurately map the aircraft¡¯s characteristics at and beyond stall angles, where, for instance, tail shadowing occurs. Ventus uses existing level-D flight simulation codes as a framework and extents this up to about 45 degrees in angle of attack, sideslip, and bank angles. Currently, Ventus reflects the Boeing 747 longitudinal flight characteristics in its clean configuration. Later, the Ventus model will provide the complete 6-DOF post-stall simulation. Verification and validation of the model is done by comparing it to the publically available NASA Boeing 747 model and to previous post-stall studies such as SUPRA.

3560,AIAA-2017-0852,Structural Analysis Methodology for Space Deployable Structures using a High Performance Parallel Nonlinear Finite Element Solver,"The Sierra Solid Mechanics computational platform is evaluated for simulating the de-ployment of large space structures. Sierra is a suite of nonlinear  nite element, multiphysicscodes developed by Sandia National Laboratories to exploit parallel computing environ-ments. Sierra includes implicit and explicit nonlinear  nite element solvers with frictionalcontact, geometrically nonlinear large motions, and material nonlinearity. This paper ex-amines the functionality, performance and scalability of Sierra using a set of deployablespace structures benchmark problems that embody the key phenomena in the structuralconcepts of interest. The focus is on comparing the implicit and explicit solvers for thesebenchmark problems. In the absence of contact, the implicit solver is found to be as muchas two orders of magnitude faster than the explicit solver, depending on the number ofprocessors. This is due to the low velocities inherent in these benchmarks. Under contact,the e ciency of the implicit solver is shown to depend on the contact velocities and on thesti ness of the contacting parts. For su ciently low rates, and with proper selection of akey augmented lagrangian scale factor, the implicit solver is found to be preferred over theexplicit solver during contact as well. These results motivate a proposed hybrid approachfor large scale simulations that alternates longer periods of implicit solution with shorterperiods of explicit solution when necessary.","Structural Analysis Methodology for Space Deployable"

Engineering design routinely involves random variables, both independent and dependent, whose distributions are not fully known. While modeling of the uncertainty in input variables is difficult, analytical methods to propagate this uncertainty to find the distributions of dependent performance variables is an even challenging task. These distributions, however, are essential if inferences need to be made about system performance, such as, its long-term reliability. In a decision-based design paradigm, where the utility function of the designer is to be maximized, this problem is exacerbated since utility functions exhibit curvature (generally concave) and their expectations are very sensitive to the variance of performance variables. We select the utility function approach to measure the desirability of a design as it provides an integrated paradigm for system performance as well as reliability. Our approach is demonstrated on a heat transfer problem encountered in many engineering applications.","Uncertainty Modeling using Mixture Distributions for "

The accurate prediction of the blade peak stress due to multi-mode excitation cannot be established using these techniques alone and requires prior knowledge of stress distribution associated with each vibratory mode. These stress distributions can be obtained using commercial finite element software. With the availability of modal stresses, real time updates of the maximum stress can be obtained using a superposition approach which requires a spatial and temporal search. The paper presents a method to obtain a critical stress limit surface that can estimate the peak vibration stresses under multimode excitation conditions. This surface can be useful to program into test devices in order to ensure that engines are tested in safe conditions and also to provide real time estimate of stresses in turbine blades.","

Acommercial aircraft with high aspect ratio wings (HARW) is generated as a baseline caseusing an in-house sizing tool, with variants of the aircraft created with a reduced sti nessvia changes in skin thicknesses, including the associated mass reduction. These aircraftvariants are modelled using an aeroelastic code based on an intrinsic beam theory in orderto understand the e ects of large, geometrically nonlinear deformations on the loads dueto level  ight and atmospheric turbulence in the form of  1-minus-cosine  gusts. The full,nonlinear results are compared to the same results obtained from the linear system andthe linearised system to determine the limits of linear analyses on gust loads predictions.It was seen that reducing the wing sti ness on the baseline aircraft reduced 1g loads due tomass reduction, and also reduced the certain loads envelopes such as root torque and rootbending moment by around 17% and 41%, respectively, compared to the baseline. Linearanalyses consistently over-predicted these loads as well as the critical gust length, even forthe sti est cases, but severely under-predicted axial and fore-aft loads.

Since VLS is a fully three-dimensional component, it will require tremendous computation for its fluid-structural interaction (FSI) analysis. Thus, efficiency of analysis should be considered to relieve the computational cost incurred. This paper presents a two-dimensional FSI approach on elasto-plastic behaviors of rear-side aft closure in VLS under the rocket plume loads. Such rocket plume load is predicted by fully Eulerian analysis. Non-linear structural model for the rear-side aft closure is obtained by total Lagrangian -based 9-node planar element. The interface between the motion and boundary conditions are described by a hybrid particle level-set method via the ghost fluid framework. Finally, coupling between the structural and rocket plume load is conducted. By this approach, computational FSI framework is established and the results are also presented.","

The nominal (no uncertainties) system dynamics of interest arelinear time-invariant, allowed to be non-minimum phase and have an arbitrary relative degree from the system control input to theregulated output. The developed control methodology relies on the Observer-Based design with Loop Transfer Recovery (OBLTR)and adaptive augmentation [7, 8]. The OBLTR portion of the design employs the squaring-up procedure [9] which is reviewed andthen extended to non-minimum phase square systems with arbitrary relative degree. For the squared-up nominal system dynamics,a robust baseline linear dynamic output feedback controller is designed, whose MIMO gain and phase margins at the plant inputrecover the margins of a state feedback optimal Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). In order to extend robustness of the baselineOBLTR controller to matched and possibly state-dependent nonlinear uncertainties, a direct model reference adaptive outputfeedback augmentation is added, followed by a concise step-by-step summary of the overall process to build a (Robust + Adaptive)dynamic output feedback servo-controller.

Stalls will be more frequently encountered by unmanned aircraft systems since most of them fly at air speeds comparable to prevailing wind and gusts in the atmospheric boundary layer. However, it is very difficult to get an accurate prediction on when stall/spin will occur for unmanned aircraft because lift estimates or angle of attack measurements may not be available. This paper provides a thorough flight test investigation of stall/spin detection techniques for a flying-wing UAS. Different types of stall data were collected through flight tests using a low-cost UAS platform, including flat stall, spin stall, vertical stall, etc. Several representative stall detection algorithms are used on the collected data including critical angle of attack estimation method, roll and yaw divergence methods. A new stall detection algorithm is proposed based on inertial angle of attack estimated without using flow angle sensors. Further analysis of collected stall data showed the effectiveness of the proposed methods for stall/spin detection and warning.","

This hardware and/or software testing methodology, utilizing a continuous spectral excitation stimulus (based on the H¨¦bert-Mackin Parameter Identification Method or HMPIM waveform)1 superimposed onto nominal signals, allows identification of systems, subsystem, or algorithm performance modeling parameters through minimal dynamic stimulation of the hardware or software in either real or non-real time environments. Exposing hardware to extensive operation and testing to determine salient system or component level modeling parameters is both costly and time consuming. Classical testing techniques such as steps, ramps, or sinusoids expose the component under test to continuous probing and shaking and each test by itself does not drive out the entire set of salient modeling parameters.

3600,AIAA-2017-1738,Passivity-Based Magnetic Attitude Control with Impulsive Thrusting,"A passivity-based design approach for hybrid magnetic attitude control of spacecraftusing continuous magnetic torques and impulsive thrusts is proposed. To this end, the classicalpassivity notions, the passivity theorem, and the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP)conditions are extended to hybrid systems, and upon considering a linearized model of thehybrid attitude control problem of interest, they are used for passivity-based controllerdesign. The output dynamics of the plant are manipulated such that the hybrid extendedKYP conditions are satisfied (upon applying some simplifying assumptions on the matricesinvolved), hence establishing the passivity of the plant. Then, evoking the hybrid passivitytheorem that states the negative feedback interconnection of a passive hybrid plant and anstrictly passive hybrid controller is input-output stable, simple proportional feedback controlinputs are assigned. In addition, previously-proposed hybrid stability analysis tools,based on an extension of the classical Floquet theory, are modified to be applicable (asan auxiliary verification tool for stability) to the passivity-based control scheme in hand.Numerical simulation results validate the functionality of the proposed passivity-basedcontrollers and suggest that performance improvements are gained using hybrid control.","Passivity-Based Magnetic Attitude Control"

In this work, a decentralized version of this problem is presented in which agents select their targets based on their effectivenesses but also coordinate to arrive at each target near-simultaneously despite arrival time constraints. The problem is formulated in a game-theoretic context where incentive structures are formulated to induce desired agent behavior. Building on previous work, a new modified cost function is presented which couples the assignment and simultaneity coordination problems. The performance of this cost function is explored in simulation, where the achieved probability of kill (Pk) and the achieved simultaneity are both considered. Results show that the proposed cost function achieves the dual goals of maximizing Pk and enforcing simultaneity to the maximum extent possible, under closing speed limitations.","

As afirst step, a numerical solver is developed by coupling the wind turbine dynamicswith a high-fidelity flow solver, thus, synchronizing the flow-turbine interaction.The solver is then used to study unsteady aerodynamics of wind-driven modifiedSavonius and HDMS VAWTs under different loading conditions. The relationshipbetween the power efficiency and tip speed ratio (TSR) is invested for both types ofwind turbines. It is found that there exists large disparity on energy harvestingperformance between the two types of VAWTs under wind-driven flow conditions.The modified Savonius VAWT achieves relatively high power efficiency (~30% or~51% of the Betz¡¯s limit) at small TSRs; the HDMS VAWT achieves high powerefficiency (~40% or ~67% of the Betz¡¯s limit) at large TSRs. At the same incomingwind speed, the maximum power efficiency of the HDMS VAWT is about 10%higher than that of the Savonius VAWT. It is also observed that the external loadingcan affect dynamic stall over Darrieus blades of the HDMS VAWT, thussignificantly varying the TSR and the corresponding energy harvesting efficiency.","

Ablation is a complexthermochemical process that is most simply described as erosion due to high-speed, hightemperatureenvironments, such as those experienced by the nozzles of solid rocket motors(SRM) and by the leading edges of hypersonic vehicles. The material used in thisinvestigation was a 3-dimensionally (3D) woven carbon/phenolic material in use on solidrocket motor nozzle cowl and aft portion of exit cones.

Kriging is a flexible surrogate model typically employed tointerpolate non-linear responses while approximating the Mean-Squared error. However,when applied to non-deterministic simulations or physical experimental data, interpolationcharacteristics of deterministic kriging become unsuitable. In this paper, the Non-Deterministic Kriging (NDK) method is proposed to capture distinguishable epistemic andaleatory uncertainties. The proposed NDK is shown to provide more physically meaningfulpredictions of both the mean trend and modeling uncertainties than existing krigingapproaches. As preliminary study, this method is also incorporated into the locallyoptimized covariance (LOC) Kriging framework to enable the prediction of non-stationarymean responses and non-stationary variation. The performance of the proposed NDKapproach is discussed with multiple numerical examples, including coupled fatigue-creep lifedetermination and the design of a generic transportation aircraft.","

Next, the sensitivity methodology is generalized for correlated quantities which occur in posterior parameter distributions, as well as in coupled analyses through time. The post-calibration sensitivity analysis is performed without requiring additional model evaluations by efficiently using input-output relationships obtained from Bayesian calibration. The methodology is used to estimate post-calibration sensitivities of coupled aerothermal models through time.

Due to limited resources and sampling uncertainty, the estimatedprobabilities have both aleatory randomness and epistemic uncertainty. The former comesfrom propagating input random variables, while the latter comes from the limited numberof samples to calculate component-level probabilities of failure. In this paper, twoapproaches are utilized to estimate the confidence intervals of component-level probabilitiesand the system-level probability. The first approach uses an analytical method, where anormal distribution is assumed for the component- and system-level probability. The otherapproach is Bootstrap method, which uses resampling to build a distribution of theprobabilities. Global sensitivity is analyzed as well in order to identify the component-levelprobability which most significantly affect the uncertainty in the system-level.

Most of the current aeroelasticmodels are based on small deformation assumption. However, with the increasing flexibilitydue to large-scaling and usage of lightweight composite materials, the rotor blades likelyundergo large displacements and rotations. The geometrically nonlinear effects on thedynamic responses and aeroelastic instability boundaries thus cannot be ignored. The widelyused blade element momentum model (BEM) has limitations in accounting for unsteadyaerodynamics effect and three dimensional effect.

3626,AIAA-2017-0129,Delaunay-based optimization in CFD leveraging multivariate adaptive polyharmonic splines (MAPS),"Delaunay-based derivative-free optimization leveraging global surrogates ( -DOGS) is a recentlydevelopedoptimization algorithm designed for nonsmooth functions in a handful of adjustable parameters.The first implementation of the original  -DOGS algorithm used polyharmonic splines todevelop an inexpensive interpolating ¡°surrogate¡± of the (expensive) function of interest. The behaviorof this surrogate was found to be irregular in cases for which the function of interest turned out to bemuch more strongly dependent on some of the adjustable parameters than others. This irregularityof the surrogate led to the optimization algorithm requiring many more function evaluations thanmight have otherwise been necessary. In the present work, a modified interpolation strategy, dubbedmultivariate adaptive polyharmonic splines (MAPS), is proposed to mitigate this irregular behavior,thereby accelerating the convergence of  -DOGS. The MAPS approach modifies the natural polyharmonicspline (NPS) approach by rescaling the parameters according to their significance in theoptimization problem based on the data available at each iteration. This regularization of the NPSapproach ultimately reduces the number of function evaluations required by  -DOGS to achieve aspecified level of convergence in optimization problems characterized by parameters of varying degreesof significance. The importance of this rescaling of the parameters during the interpolation stepis problem specific. To quantify its beneficial impact on a practical problem, we compare  -DOGSwith MAPS to  -DOGS with NPS on an application related to hydrofoil shape optimization in sevenparameters; results indicate a notable acceleration of convergence leveraging the MAPS approach.","Delaunay-based optimization in CFD leveraging"

The results suggest that theunsteady adjoint information provided by this AD-based discrete adjoint framework is accurate and robust,due to the algorithmic differentiation of the entire design chain including the dynamic mesh movement routineand various turbulence model, as well as the hybrid CFD-CAA model.","The AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition, January 2017, Grapevine, Texas"
3628,AIAA-2017-0131,Comparison of Unifed and Sequential-Approximate Approaches to Multifdelity Optimization,"Multi delity approaches are frequently used in engineering design when high- delitymodels are too expensive to use directly and lower  delity models of reasonable accu-racy exist. In optimization, corrected low- delity data is typically used in a series ofsequential optimizations bounded by trust regions around the approximate model. Eachsub-optimization is independent of the previous one, except for the starting design andtrust region size. A new uni ed multi delity quasi-Newton approach is presented thatpreserves an estimate of the inverse Hessian between iterations, determining search di-rections from high- delity data and using approximate models for single line searches.The proposed algorithm produces better search directions, maintains larger step sizes,and requires signi cantly fewer low- delity function evaluations than Trust Region ModelManagement.","Comparison of Uni(cid:12)ed and Sequential-Approximate"

Adaptive control techniques havebeen shown to be useful in circumstances with this type of parametric uncertainty, and soare often utilized for the control of hypersonic aircraft. In addition to these di culties,another challenge present for all aircraft, but especially vehicles ying at hypersonic speeds,is the ability to accurately measure angle-of-attack. Often this challenge is neglected inthe literature and it is assumed that angle-of-attack can be measured perfectly. For thecase of hypersonic vehicles, this assumption is hard to validate. Therefore, an observer-based feedback adaptive controller is presented that utilizes a nonlinear observer, and iscapable of controlling a fully nonlinear longitudinal model of a hypersonic vehicle withoutmeasuring angle-of-attack. The observer is designed with the ability to lessen the inuenceof noisy measurement signals. All tracking and estimation errors are shown to be ultimatelybounded, and the ability of this control architecture to track a command signal in thepresence of noise is demonstrated on a high  delity simulation.","Observer-Based Feedback Adaptive Control for"

3636,AIAA-2017-1486,Active Camber Control of Flexible Airfoils using Artificial Hair Sensors,"Wing flexibility can be proactively exploited in high-performance aircraft, where the wing configurations are designed to be adaptive to different flight conditions and missions. Nonetheless, the shape change of flexible wings has to be controlled by a robust mechanism and algorithm. The wing flexibility itself may cause a delay between the control input and the wing response. To ensure the desired wing shape is achieved during the flight, the instant wing shape needs to be estimated and further considered in the controller design. This paper focus on active control of the wing camber shape. Particularly, the instantaneous camber deformation of a flexible airfoil is predicted by Artificial Hair Sensors (AHS) installed around its surface. The raw sensor measurement data, simulated by using XFoil in this study, are processed by using Artificial Neural Network to estimate the instantaneous airfoil camber shape. The predicted airfoil camber shape is then be fed to the control loop to obtain the camber actuation input. This algorithm is tested on a flexible airfoil with the conformal camber change capability for its alleviation of external gust perturbations.","Active Camber Control of Flexible Airfoils using Artificial "

The system includes a decision making scheme,positional prediction of targets, an aircraft model analysis, and a basic fighter maneuvering(BFM)-based combat guidance law designed to generate effective combat maneuvers. A oneon-one combat simulation environment is set up, and the virtual fighter pilot (VFP) combatsimulation results are addressed. The VFP proposed in this paper follows the mindset of anreal human pilot, and all the subcomponents that reflect the thought processes aremodularized. The designed BFM-based aerial combat guidance law conducts suboptimalcombat maneuvers in real time. In order for a fighter jet to attain advantageous positions inaerial combat, it must have the ability to carry out high agility maneuvers. Therefore, a V-ndiagram and an energy-maneuverability chart analysis are used to determine the limits ofthe aircraft¡¯s flight operable regions and to find the corner velocity of the aircraft model forthe maximum rate of turn. Based on the measured combat geometry, the VFP carries outdecision making processes and assesses situations in terms of scoring functions. In order topreoccupy advantageous geometry in combat, the system estimates the future positions ofthe target using velocity estimation-based target prediction. The modularized VFP isdesigned using a MATLAB/Simulink, and its simulation environment is designed based onan F-16 model.

Most classical con-trol design methods are based on linearized mathematical description of plant dynamics.However MAVs have nonlinear dynamics and are prone to parametric uncertainties anddisturbances while ying.

When thrust into a 3-dimensional, e.g. humans flying in aircraft, these same structures are woefully unprepared and can cause spatial disorientation. The insidious nature of spatial disorientation is such that often a person does not realize that he/she is disoriented. When this occurs in aircraft it can and has resulted in incidents and the loss of aircraft, crew, and passengers. In response to these incidents, an effort has been made to develop demonstration scenarios in a Level D Boeing 747 simulator for both pitch and roll axis of which the pitch axis scenario is described herein. The focus was on non-visual somatogravic illusions. The scenario developed was for a missed approach/go-around in which a false sensation of pitch due to acceleration can occur. Formal simulator evaluations of the scenario consisted of fourteen pilots, two of whom were guest pilots from the Federal Aviation Administration, to evaluate the effectiveness of the spatial disorientation demonstration.

Fifteen airlinetransport pilots flew the same three tasks as the previous experiment in the NASA Vertical Motion Simula-tor under six different motion conditions. The six different motion configurations covered the motion regionbetween the motion fidelity uncertainty boundary found in the previous experiment and the mean motionresponse of a statistical sample of eight representative hexapod motion simulators. The motion condition sig-nificantly affected 1) roll deviations in the approach to a stall and maximum pitch rate in the stall recovery,and 2) heading deviation and reaction time after an engine failure in the takeoff task. Significant differencesin pilot-vehicle performance were used to develop objective motion cueing criteria boundaries. In addition,motion perception thresholds were used to develop motion cueing criteria for the cross-coupling motion re-sponses. The fidelity boundaries of the current experiment did not allow us to reduce the uncertainty of theinitial fidelity boundaries developed in the previous experiment yet.

To this aim, the energetic decomposition of the fluid field is first developed from conservation equations. By defining multi-dimensional energetic components, possible reversible and irreversible connections between the subdomains are then clarified with which distinctive energy transformation between the subdomains and energy transportation within the fluid field become identifiable. Finally, the general energetic network of the system is achieved, which demonstrates the power transactions within the system in a conservative manner. The model thus generated is capable of presenting the complex behavior of the system attached to the system energetic memory.

As such, implementation of higher fidelityanalysis methods that more accurately capture fiber misalignment due to geometricconvergence are not demonstrated to be necessary to model the glass skins.","

We have conducted uniaxial loading-unloading simulations where strain is applied up to 0.15 to observe the distinct plastic behavior of local chain segments. During the deformation, internal potential components such as pair, bond, angle, torsion, and improper energies have been rigorously monitored and their related molecular movements also observed in microscopic level to investigate the deformation energy accommodation. Specifically, irreversible behavior of internal energy components like pair and torsion has been observed and the behavior of torsional angle becomes prominent in epoxy cured by aromatic curing agent. In line with this trend, contribution of internal potential to the total stress has been derived with seperate consideration on the epoxy resin and curing agent. The profile for the stress also denote the contribution of aromatic curing agent on the irreversible behavior corresponding to the internal energy profiles.","Elasto-plastic deformation mechanisms of thermoset glassy "

Inthis approach, variability in the input parameters of the FE model is introduced as thesuperposition of a number of base vectors de ned over the model topology, each of whichis scaled by an independent interval factor. The application of the IF concept to real lifeproblems requires the identi cation of these parameters based on experimental data. Inthis context, the authors presented a novel identi cation procedure for multivariate intervaluncertainty using dynamic FE models in previous work. The objective of this paper is toextend this methodology towards the identi cation of interval  eld uncertainty using quasi-static displacement  elds measured with Digital Image Correlation (DIC). On the onehand, the paper shows how the method deals with the corresponding large experimentalDIC data sets by selecting the optimal reduced output set for the envisaged interval  eldidenti cation. Secondly, also the e ect of measurement errors during the experimentalacquisition of the DIC reference data on the identi cation procedure is analysed. Forthis purpose, a case study concerning a plastic PA12 part produced by Laser Sintering isperformed. In this study, the base vectors are constructed based on the expert knowledge ofthe authors on the additive process obtained in prior work. The methodology is presentedand validated using numerically generated measurement data enabling the assessment ofthe robustness and accuracy of the identi cation with respect to the experimental accuracyand data set size.

3670,AIAA-2017-1772,Variance Reduction Estimation in Bayesian Inference,"In Bayesian inference, whether the data of an observation variable can reduce the uncertainty of a state variable is of interest. It is desired to estimate the uncertainty reduction of the state variable before conducting Bayesian inference to assure that the data collection is not waste of effort. Intuitively, this uncertainty reduction should be significant if the state variable is sensitive to the observation variable. This implies to apply global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to Bayesian network to solve this problem. The desired GSA for Bayesian network confronts two challenges. First, Sobol¡¯ index selected as the sensitivity index requires a deterministic function while the Bayesian network is a stochastic model. Second, the computation of Sobol¡¯ index can be expensive, especially if the model inputs are correlated, which is common in a Bayesian network. To solve the first challenge, this paper uses the auxiliary variable method to convert the path between two nodes in the Bayesian network to a deterministic function, thus making the Sobol¡¯ index computation feasible. To solve the second challenge, this paper applies the MGSA algorithm proposed by the authors to directly estimate the first-order Sobol¡¯ index from samples of the prior distribution of the Bayesian network. Finally, this MGSA algorithm is extended to estimate the variance reduction in Bayesian inference based on the samples of the prior distributions. Before data collection, the proposed method indicates which variable should be observed to reach the highest variance reduction on the variable of interest; after data collection, the proposed method predicts how much variance reduction can be expected in the subsequent Bayesian inference.","

This strategy is employed to achieve handling qualities and response types de nedfor a new kind of vehicle, namely the Personal Aerial Vehicle (PAV). PAVs are meant to beaugmented rotorcraft that are far easier and more intuitive to y than typical rotorcraft.The rotorcraft considered in this work is the Sikorsky UH-60. The state-space model isobtained by linearizing a 6 degrees of freedom nonlinear model in hover trim condition.The controller is implemented and validated with the state-space model and then testedwith the nonlinear model. The control design is optimized to enhance stability margins,improve disturbance rejection properties and account for actuation limits. The evaluationis performed considering the metrics of the Aeronautical Design Standard (ADS-33E-PRF).Results and handling qualities evaluations show the achievement of the required charac-teristics and the robustness of the controller against air turbulences.

We present work on a virtual reality systemthat combines low  delity physical prototypes, called \passive haptics"", with high  delityvisuals provided by a virtual reality head-mounted display. Interaction with the prototypeis achieved using an optical hand tracker. We evaluate the system with a Fitts' ISO9241-9experiment on a virtual panel with 20 subjects. Fitts' throughput was signi cantly in-creased with the passive haptics compared to having no haptics, and training time wasdecreased. Subjective feedback from the subjects indicate they prefer the passive hapticsfor interacting with the virtual panel, and feel they are performing faster and more accu-rately. The use of this type of simulator has applications in prototyping cockpit designs,as well as for training in deployed situations where resources are minimal.","Passive Haptics to Enhance Virtual Reality"
3706,AIAA-2017-1079,Evaluation of a Steep Turn Spatial Disorientation Demonstration Scenario for Commercial Pilot Training,"A study of world-wide commercial jet transport accidents by The Boeing Company found the most common events to be loss of control associated with an inability of pilots to recover from upsets and unusual attitudes. A key component in some of these events was pilot spatial disorientation. In terms of non-visual illusion cases, the spatial disorientation most commonly took the form of somatogravic and/or somatogyral illusions. Somatogravic illusions are those associated with the false sensation of body tilt, while somatogyral illusions are those associated with the inability of the human to perceive extended rotations. Improved pilot training in these abnormal flight conditions, including the ability of commercial pilot training simulators to replicate spatial disorientation, is needed to reduce loss of control accidents. A Federal Aviation Adminstration-sponsored program led by Systems Technology, Inc. has developed spatial disorientation demonstration training scenarios using the B747-400 flight simulator at NASA Ames Research Center. This paper addresses the evaluation of a steep bank, constant altitude turn scenario. Formal evaluations of the scenario were conducted with 12 commercial airline pilots and two FAA pilots. Quantitative and qualitative results of the study found that the steep turn scenario provided an effective demonstration of spatial disorientation for commercial pilot training.","Evaluation of a Steep Turn Spatial Disorientation "

3726,AIAA-2017-1675,Structural Health Management of Damaged Aircraft Structures Using Digital Twin Concept,"The development of multidisciplinary integrated Structural Health Management (SHM) tools willenable accurate detection, and prognosis of damaged aircraft under normal and adverse conditions duringflight. As part of the digital twin concept, methodologies are developed by using integrated multiphysicsmodels, sensor information and input data from an in-service vehicle to mirror and predict the life of itscorresponding physical twin. SHM tools are necessary for both damage diagnostics and prognostics forcontinued safe operation of damaged aircraft structures. The adverse conditions include loss of controlcaused by environmental factors, actuator and sensor faults or failures, and structural damage conditions.A major concern in these structures is the growth of undetected damage/cracks due to fatigue and lowvelocity foreign object impact that can reach a critical size during flight, resulting in loss of control of theaircraft. To avoid unstable, catastrophic propagation of damage during a flight, load levels must bemaintained that are below a reduced load-carrying capacity for continued safe operation of an aircraft.Hence, a capability is needed for accurate real-time predictions of damage size and safe load carryingcapacity for structures with complex damage configurations. In the present work, a procedure is developedthat uses guided wave responses to interrogate damage. As the guided wave interacts with damage, thesignal attenuates in some directions and reflects in others. This results in a difference in signal magnitudeas well as phase shifts between signal responses for damaged and undamaged structures. Accurateestimation of damage size, location, and orientation is made by evaluating the cumulative signal responsesat various pre-selected sensor locations using a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization procedure. Thedamage size, location, and orientation is obtained by minimizing the difference between the referenceresponses and the responses obtained by wave propagation finite element analysis of differentrepresentative cracks, geometries, and sizes.","Structural Health Management of Damaged Aircraft "

In addition, mass savings can be achieved via the use of high specific strength softgoods materials, and the reduced design penalty from launching the structure in a densely packaged state. Large inclusions however, such as hatches, induce a high mass penalty at the interfaces with the softgoods and in the added rigid structure while reducing the packaging efficiency. A novel, Non-Axisymmetric Inflatable Pressure Structure (NAIPS) was designed and recently tested at NASA Langley Research Center to demonstrate an elongated inflatable architecture that could provide areas of low stress along a principal axis in the surface. These low stress zones will allow the integration of a flexible linear seal that substantially reduces the added mass and volume associated with a heritage rigid hatch structure.

3732,AIAA-2017-1822,Challenges in Using Measured Data to Assess Payload Stresses and Fatigue Life,"This paper proposes ways to process test data for effective use in forced responseanalysis. In designing payloads for flight in an airplane or launch vehicle, or eventransportation by road vehicle, the analysis to support the design often must rely onenvironments described by interface control documents or specifications. The use of datafrom actual flight or operation of the same or a similar vehicle with a similar-weight payloadseems ideal for this purpose. However, users are often plagued by very severe strainpredictions and negative stress margins because measurements often include drift or othertypes of errors that can cause large errors in analysis predictions. In addition,inconsistencies in phase from different measurements can introduce artificially large strainpredictions. This paper offers important checks and processing of test data that make thesedata more effective and efficient for use as input forcing functions for forced response ofdynamic structural analysis models. One example of these suggestions is the projection of theactual measurements onto the rigid body modes, or possibly a larger set of basis modalfunctions, of the base of the payload model. Another is the transformation of time-historyacceleration measurements into cleanly separated sine, random, and shock components,along with recombination of components into time histories that preserve the statistics of theenvironment and allow the analysis to produce strain histories that can be used directly forfatigue, as strain gage histories are used.","

First, theexact finite element magnetic force is accurately fitted with a fifth-order polynomialrepresentation in order to use it for low spacing distances between the two magnets.Second, the static pull-in of attractive magnetic forces with same spacing distances isdetermined and compared to the static pull-in of single attractive magnetic force. Third,through an eigenvalue problem analysis, the impacts of the spacing distance between themagnets on the fundamental natural frequency of the energy harvester are deeplystudied. Fourth, a nonlinear distributed-parameter model is derived using the Galerkindiscretization. The results show that the inclusion of the second magnetic force with anattractive interaction results in a delay in the static pull-in and a decrease in thefundamental natural frequency for same spacing distances. It is also shown thathardening behaviors take place in the dual attractive magnets compared to softeningbehaviors in the single magnet scenario. It is demonstrated that the attractive dualmagnets with same spacing distances lead to the presence of broadband resonance regionswhen the spacing distance between the magnets decreases to lower values. This suggesteddesign and analysis gives guidelines about the possibility of designing low-frequencypiezoelectric energy harvesters with broadband resonance regions."," Analytical modeling and effectiveness of low-frequency piezoelectric energy "

We assumethat the vehicle is actuated by a single gimbaled rocket motor with lower and upper thrustbounds, and that aerodynamic forces are negligible. Solving this problem in real-time ischallenging for three reasons. First, it is non-convex due to its thrust-magnitude lowerbound, mass-depletion dynamics, and attitude dynamics. Second, the consistency of at-titude transformations is highly dependent on the magnitude of the attitude quaternion,thus making the accuracy of the problem discretization key. Third, the initialization ofan iterative process can be challenging since a suitable reference trajectory is not readilyavailable. Our algorithm addresses these issues in the following ways.

As a result, innovative ideasare required to enable future high-mass Mars landing missions. One such promisingapproach is to use an inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (IAD). Compared withtraditional rigid aeroshells, IADs are made of lightweight, flexible materials that canbe folded into a smaller volume in the rocket payload fairing and inflated prior toatmospheric entry. Such IADs are able to reduce the ballistic coefficient and peakheating, providing an opportunity to land at higher surface elevations on Mars.Currently, NASA Langley Research Center is investigating the development ofHypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIADs) to enable future largerobotic and human exploration missions. Much of the previous work performed onHIADs has focused on symmetric shapes that fly through the atmosphere withballistic trajectories or trajectories with low lift-to-drag ratios accomplished via CGoffset.The present investigation assesses the technical feasibility of a novel HIADconcept that can vary lift-to-drag ratios between 0.2 and 0.5, is aerodynamicallystable between 0.6 km/s and 6.5 km/s, is extensible to aeroshell diameters of 15 to 20meters, and possesses an approximately smooth outer mold line to avoid localizedheating.","

Our focus here is on the developmentof a probabilistic model to predict how the target density will evolve given the probabilistic dynamicmotion of the targets on the road network. By discretizing the road network into small cells and considering thepossible number of targets in each cell, we construct a state-dependent Hidden Markov models (HMM) basedlearning model that describes the state transition probability. The target density distribution is then estimatedby computing the expected number of targets in each cell. The proposed formal method can also address thebirth/death of targets.

3776,AIAA-2017-1380,Design of a Boundary-Layer Suction System for Trailing-Edge Noise Reduction of an Industrial Wind Turbine,"Distributed boundary-layer suction has numerically and experimentally shown impres-sive potential to reduce flow-induced trailing-edge noise, further proven with the transferof this potential to a generic full-size wind turbine by means of a dedicated suction systemdesign. The present work is meant to point out whether the predicted improvements carryover to industrial turbines represented by the N117, not hitherto in liaison with active flowcontrol. Guidance is given through the different design steps involving the suction-followedblowing of the fluid and being continually dictated by industrial constraints and require-ments. Since the processes of trailing-edge noise reduction and effective power alterationare intimately bound together, great emphasis is put on an accurate prediction of pumppower requirement, the latter being based on a detailed suction hardware system implyingpressure losses across each component. Exploiting the maximum installation space, a totaltrailing-edge noise reduction of 2 dB is coupled with an enhancement of total rotor powerof 2%. As of a cross-over noise reduction level of 3 dB, the enhancement of aerodynamicpower no longer compensates for the pump power requirement and, hence, aeroacousticdemands are implemented to the detriment of aerodynamic performance. Striving for ac-cessability of the pump, additional pressure losses are introduced slightly weakening theoverall potential of the suction system. An in-depth analysis of the associated designs shallreveal the major shares of pump power.","Design of a Boundary-Layer Suction System for"

In this study, the e ect of leading-edgetubercles on fatigue loadings on wind turbine blades is investigated using an aeroelasticmodel that couples a composite beam to the unsteady vortex-lattice method. To accommo-date the leading-edge tubercles, spanwise structural properties and aerodynamic geometriesare varied, which resulted in a reduction in both torsional frequencies and aerodynamiclift despite keeping the same planform area. The reductions in structural frequencies andaerodynamics have counteracting e ects on fatigue responses, with the former increasingand the latter reducing loads. On a turbine blade with tubercles (amplitude of 0.2c andwavelength of 0.5c) occupying 20% to 95% span of the leading-edge, apwise root-bendingmoment was found to be 6% lower than the unmodi ed con guration, which can be furtherenhanced with a trough termination at the blade tip. Torsional moment was 17% lowerdue to the reduction in leading-edge suction along tubercle crests, which are further awayfrom the elastic axis. In terms of tubercle positioning, having tubercles close to the bladetip enables performance enhancement during episodes of stall from large tip deectionsand has signi cant contributions to root-bending moment due to a larger moment arm andhigher relative ow speed. On the other hand, positioning tubercles close to the blade rootmay also be favoured as this region is prone to stall from low speeds, yet having little e ecton fatigue responses.","Bio-inspired Leading-Edge Tubercles to Improve"

A new version, the Slit-LockTM boom, is introduced here to exhibit substantial shear stiffness by creating edge features that interlock as the boom is unfurled. Composite Technology Development (CTD) teamed with the Air Force Research Laboratory and LoadPath to measure the bending stiffness and buckling strength of a Slit-LockTM boom while CTD predicted the structural performance using a numerical model. The 10.2 cm diameter, 5.85 m long boom was potted at the ends to fix end-shear and attached to a reaction structure through simple supports. Overall the boom responded to bending loads with linearity and repeatability. The orientation of the slit with respect to the bend axis affected the stiffness and strength response. The Slit-LockTM seems to carry bending loads with similar effectiveness as a tube with a closed-section for shear-locked end boundary conditions. Modeling Slit-LockTM behavior with a commercial finite element model appears feasible with the model accurately predicted bending stiffness for the different orientations of the slit. The model accurately predicted the elastically recoverable buckling mode shape for the slit loaded in compression but over-predicted the critical moment by 21% to 65% for this case. For the slit loaded in tension, failure followed the classical local crippling mode, and the model predicted this critical moment within 4% of measured.","Experimental and Analytical Characterization of a  "

The differences encountered in the validation exercise are analyzed and explained.The computations display similar trends to those of the experimental data without achievinga perfect match. The discrepancies are due to the the linear and inviscid formulation of themethod.

The test leveraged the work and test techniques developed during earlier NASA Orion dynamic stability test campaign. The TDT is the only facility in the nation that contains the test apparatus and R134a test medium necessary for this type of dynamic stability test. The test apparatus allows for testing over a full 360¡ã angle of attack range without remounting the model. Moreover, the apparatus allows for a seamless transition from static to dynamic testing due to both the mechanism design and the use of the same six-component strain gauge balance for either test type.

Two significant difficulties present in the control of flapping wing air vehicles are model uncertainty and sensitivity to external disturbances such as wind gusts. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Sliding Mode Control (SMC) in controlling a biomimetic FWMAV in hover during simulations in the pitch-plane. The controller successfully accounts for the aforementioned model uncertainty as well as the external disturbances that such a small vehicle would encounter during operation. Both classical sliding mode control and a second order sliding mode method are developed and presented for this problem, both of which are able to control a bumblebee-size vehicle in a range of non-optimal initial conditions, initial control inputs, and in the face of external wind gusts.

Sensors instrumented on aircraft normally measure pressures and flow angles in thelocal flow field using vanes and probes. However, aircraft requires the free streamparameters for flying. Therefore, forward lookup tables in Air Data Computer (ADC) areused to covert local parameters measured using airdata sensor to free stream parameters. Inorder to design flight controls, improved system performance, ADS should deliver accurateoutput. Accuracy of free stream parameters depends upon the accuracy of these tables in Airdata computer. In this paper, the airdata system of a modern fighter aircraft is considered.This system carries airdata tables which are calibrated/updated using Maximum LikelihoodEstimation (MLE) method. The accuracy of it needs to be determined by anotherindependent technique. Hence an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is proposed to calibrateand describe the accuracy limits of airdata system. The technique is tested with flight dataand the results demonstrate the strength of the technique for airdata calibration andaccuracy determination.","Calibration and accuracy determination of airdata system "

The proposed approach consists in a current output-feedbackiterative learning control law that combines a causal output feedback and a non-caucal feed-forward learning component. A new con dence level factor is introduced in the algorithmto carefully, and iteratively, transition learning from a conservative to a con dent process.Simulations and experiments performed at Carleton University's Spacecraft Robotics andControl Laboratory demonstrate the performance of the new con dence-based learningapproach in a spacecraft robotic inspection maneuver scenario.

However, the applicationof learning algorithms, such as as Reinforcement Learning, is challenged by two mainissues. First, safety and stability is not guaranteed due to the unpredictability of untrainedcontrollers; second, initial performance can be low, since considerable real-life samplesare required for training. These limitations can be signi cantly improved by HierarchicalReinforcement Learning (HRL). This paper expands on the issue of safety by applying anHRL control to a simulated UAV platform operating in an unknown environment. It willbe shown how a managerial hierarchical structure, combined with a crude knowledge ofthe physical model and simulated sensory outputs, can increase safety during exploratoryight.","Hierarchically Structured Controllers for Safe UAV"

Cockpit audio recordings contain sounds of the crew conversations,alarms, engine noise, etc.; analysis of which may assist in the investigations of incidentsand accidents. This paper focuses on the analysis of the engine sounds that may be loggedby any recording within the cockpit. The analysis of engine sounds can serve as a methodto evaluate the state of the engine from cockpit audio. However, this is a challenging taskas cockpit audio does not provide a clean engine audio and the noise pro les of di erentengines vary greatly. This paper proposes an engine noise analysis algorithm to estimateengine related ight parameters and identify anomalous engine behavior. This is doneusing signal analysis, data mining, and statistical modeling techniques to identify speci cfrequencies associated to engine operations. The proposed algorithm is successfully appliedto real cockpit audio data to demonstrate and validate its performance.","Helicopter Engine State Estimation via Cockpit Audio"

After intensive search since then, international team still has not beenable to locate any  rst-hand evidence from the missing plane's ight data recorders (alsoknown as `blackboxes'). To mitigate similar problems, a proposal has been made to anal-yse live streamed ight data using cloud computing; however, satellite communication isconstrained by bandwidth and scalability challenges.1 In this paper, we propose  ve re-quirements for addressing these challenges.

3817,AIAA-2017-1083,Experimental evaluation of haptic support systems for learning a 2-DoF tracking task,"This paper investigates use of a haptic support system for learning purposes. A 2Degrees of Freedom (DoF) haptic force feedback system was designed for a dual-axes com-pensatory tracking task. The haptic system was used in a human-in-the-loop experimentwith inexperienced participants on a  xed-base simulator. In the experiment, partici-pants were divided into 3 groups. All participants performed 30 trials of the compensatorytracking task. One group of participants (NoHA group) performed the whole experimentwithout haptic aid. The other two groups (HA20 and HA10 groups) performed a train-ing phase with haptic aid, followed by an evaluation phase without haptic feedback. TheHA20 group performed 20 trials in the training phase, whereas the HA10 group performedonly 10 trials. The results show that haptic aid was bene cial for performing the trackingtask in the training phase for both the axes, compared to manual control. In the pitchaxis performance of the HA20 group did not worsen when the feedback was switched o ,whereas a considerable deterioration in performance was visible for HA10 group. Thus,haptic force feedback was e ective to learn the control task in the pitch axis, compared tomanual control. In the roll axis overall performance was found to be worse than the pitchaxis. Moreover no bene ts were found from training with haptic feedback in the roll axisfor both the haptic groups.","Experimental Evaluation of Haptic Support Systems"
3818,AIAA-2017-1084,Assessing the severity of wake encounters in various aircraft types in piloted flight simulations,"The ICAO wake turbulence separation standards for approaching and departing aircraft are considered safe and to some extent over-conservative for certain pairs of aircraft and in certain conditions. With the need to improve efficiency and capacity in particular at the larger busy airports, research has been ongoing to come up with concepts aiming at optimised, weather dependent and pair-wise separation minima. The safety analysis of the European pair-wise concept (RECAT-PWS-EU) as developed by EUROCONTROL Agency is based on a relative assessment, using the dimensionless Roll Moment Coefficient (RMC) as the metric expressing wake encounter severity. Separation design is based on the principle that the worst-case RMC value that an aircraft type is exposed to, will be less than or equal to the worst-case RMC that a smaller reference aircraft is exposed to. The applicability of this alignment principle may be limited to aircraft within a certain category, because other factors than RMC may play a role in the experienced severity for aircraft that differ significantly in size and manoeuvrability. With the objective to create additional assurance that the estimated severity levels at the defined separations are actually comparable and acceptable, EUROCONTROL in collaboration with the Netherlands Aerospace Centre NLR have conducted a campaign with realistic piloted flight simulations in the framework of the SESAR programme. A range of aircraft types has been simulated in NLR¡¯s GRACE research simulator facility. More than 700 wake encounters have been flown in realistic level flight and final approach scenarios. Pilot ratings of the severity and flight data have been analysed in combination. The results show that the RMC is a good metric for wake encounter severity. The pilot ratings for the various aircraft types correlate well with RMC values, especially in level flight. In approach, closer to ground at around 200 ¨C 100 ft, pilot rating also correlates with deviations from the stabilized approach and go-around intentions. The results support the alignment as applied in the RECAT-PWS-EU Safety Case.","

Theheritage and lessons learned from the International Space Station can be utilized. However,we must consider unique conditions in cislunar orbits. Relative orbital motion is totallydifferent from that of low Earth orbits. A guidance law must be developed considering thedynamics dominated by the features of the multibody problem. Previous works related toorbits about cislunar libration point mainly investigated the orbit itself, such as stability,efficiency for space mission, and mathematical features. This work focuses on relativemotion of two spacecrafts in cislunar orbit, and it is practical research on rendezvousmission architecture. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of monodromy matrix of periodic orbitsare the key to analyze chaser¡¯s relative motion to target spacecraft. The features of relativemotion are related to invariant manifolds which can be defined based on six eigenvalues.Invariant manifolds can be utilized to predict how chaser¡¯s trajectories are propagated withrespect to target spacecraft. In this paper, three types of cislunar orbits, Near RectilinearOrbits, Earth-Moon L2 halo orbits, and Distant Retrograde Orbits are investigated. It isproposed that a guidance law to target an arbitrary relative position is derived from a statetransition matrix which is obtained by integral of the matrix of differential equation. Theaccuracy of the guidance law is evaluated, and it is demonstrated by solving practicalrendezvous guidance problems.","A Study on Rendezvous Trajectory Design Utilizing "

For small UAVs, these approaches are limitedby hardware capabilities. This paper presents a method for using highly compressed versionsof optimal solutions computed offline to guide autonomous UAVs. The problem of finding the fastesttrajectory to a waypoint is framed as a Markov decision process and solved using discrete value iteration.The resulting solution is a state-action score table requiring more than 100MB of memory. Thetable is then compressed by training a neural network to approximate the actions given by the scoretable. Simulations demonstrate that there is negligible loss in performance when using the neuralnetwork approximation in place of the state-action score table, even though the parameters of thenetwork require only 5KB of memory. Flight tests with a UAV using an onboard neural networkguidance system to fly a race course show that neural networks can accurately and robustly guideUAVs through a series of waypoints. In comparison to mixed-integer linear programming, the neuralnetwork generates very similar time-optimal trajectories but requires significantly less time tocompute.","Neural Network Guidance for UAVs"

Previous works established a definition and candidate scenario,demonstrated a methodology, formulated the optimal control problem, and developed dynamic and measurementupdate models for avoiding moving, stochastic threats. The work herein extends upon previous workby formulating the optimal control problem for a scenario more consistent with manned-unmanned teaming.Additional technical information is provided for appropriately modeling the moving, stochastic threats and acritical distance metric is developed to recommend when the loyal wingman¡¯s optimal path should be updated,using speed and stochastics of the moving threat as well as relative distance and angle of approach of theloyal wingman to the threat.

The initial failurephenomenon prior to the blade collapse is investigated using video recorded images. Postcollapsecharacteristics of the blade are examined to identify the critical failure modes. Afinite element model is constructed considering the constraint effect of loading saddles on theblade section. Structural response of the blade section during the loading process isinvestigated numerically. It is found that delamination and fracture of the spar cap are twocritical failure modes responsible for the root causes of the blade collapse. These criticalfailure modes are evoked by local buckling of blade shells and shear webs. Numerical resultsshow that the Brazier effect imposes significant crushing pressure to the blade cross sectionand contribute to local buckling. Moreover, it is found that torsion loads, althoughinsignificant compared with the primary bending loads applied to the blade, affect postcollapsecharacteristics of the blade in this study.","Collapse of a 47-meter Composite Blade under Combined "

The HAWKS model turbine control is capable of instantaneously altering the thrust coefficient (CT) and power coefficient (Cp) through rapid changes in blade pitch, turbine yaw, and rotor speed. In this study, HAWKS capabilities were tested by analyzing the concept of dynamic induction factor control, a potential control strategy to increase windfarm power production. The rotor induction factor was altered by continuously varying the rotor RPM. This affects turbulence structure of the wake, reducing the wake velocity deficit due to enhanced turbulent transport of freestream momentum into the wake. Furthermore, it was observed that wake deflection can also be affected by changing the rotor speed.","

Univariate ARMA models are used to maintain the correlation of stochasticloads over time. The vine-copula model can account for not only correlations betweendifferent univariate ARMA models, but also the tail dependence of different ARMA models.The proposed Vine-ARMA model is able to flexibly model a vector of high-dimensionalcorrelated non-Gaussian stochastic processes with the consideration of tail dependence.

To this end, we develop a linear smoothing scheme in the Rodriguesfundamental region to compute the ODF from the EBSD data. The joint multivariateprobability distributions of the ODF are then modeled using a Gaussian assumption. Wealso compute the uncertainty in engineering properties that are obtained by homogeniza-tion.

3838,AIAA-2017-1773,Fuzzy Logic Controller Stability Analysis Using a Satisfiability Modulo Theories Approach,"Whereas many widely accepted methods and techniques exist for showing stability of traditional controllers, at this time standard methods have not been adopted for Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLCs). Due to the highly non-linear nature of such systems it is quite difficult to use conventional techniques to prove controller stability. Because safety-critical systems (such as flight control systems) must be tested and verified to work as expected for all possible circumstances, the fact that FLCs cannot be proven to achieve such requirements poses limitations on the implementation for such systems. Therefore, alternative methods for verification of an FLC¡¯s behavior, including stability, need to be explored. In this study, a novel approach using formal verification methods to ensure the stability of an FLC is proposed. The research challenges include specification of requirements for a complex system, conversion of a traditional FLC to a piecewise polynomial representation, and using a formal verification tool in a non-linear solution space. Using the proposed architecture, the Fuzzy Logic Controller was found to always generate negative feedback, but was inconclusive for Lyapunov stability.","
3839,AIAA-2017-1774,Design of Multi-Level Validation Experiments for Multi-Physics Systems,"For multi-physics systems, it is often too complex or costly to perform experiments that fully capture the loads and conditions present in the actual system. Therefore, experiments are performed with conditions corresponding to smaller subsystems of the coupled model, creating a multi-level system. When data at these different levels are brought together and used to calibrate models, it is difficult to determine which regions of the space have been covered by experiments. In this paper, we investigate an approach to design model validation experiments by accounting for the placement of the experiment defined by distance from the calibration and extrapolation spaces across the different levels of the system. These spaces are defined by the convex hull of the calibration experiments, where the predictions are assumed to be more reliable than extrapolations. For multi-level models, where each model is assumed to have its own calibration data set, the placement of a validation experiment for one system can be related to its location relative to the convex hull of calibration data of other systems that capture a different set of experimental conditions. The goal of the method is to assess the models by providing an experimental data point that is within the calibration space of all model components.","

This study expands upon previous work that showed that antisymmetric composite coupling in the spar of a UH-60A-like rotor can provide a significant increase in the lift to drag ratio of a rotor when the RPM is reduced. The current analysis was performed using a full 3-D FEA based aeroelastic computational structural dynamics (CSD) solver, X3D, now with the inclusion of a freewake aerodynamics model. This was validated using extant UH-60A test data for high advance ratios. The current analysis shows that a blade with composite coupling can provide a maximum increase of in the lift to drag ratio of approximately 1.5 at 85% of the nominal RPM (NR) of 27 rad/s. However, close study of the strain in the rotor showed that the coupled rotor would unlikely be feasible at 27 rad/s as the axial strains felt by the rotor around the azimuth often exceed the allowable tensile strain of 6000 ??. The details of what can be done to reduce the axial strain at all rotational speeds is part of an ongoing investigation.","

3844,AIAA-2017-1821,Diffuse Acoustic Field Shaping in Acoustic Boundary Element Method using Gradient Based Optimization Technique,"A common practice in the acoustic boundary element analysis of aerospace structures today is to assume perfectly uniform diffuse acoustic field in an empty space and immerse a structure model into it. In most cases, such acoustic loading methodology for structure loads evaluation is appropriate or at least sufficient. However, the previous work presented by the authors at the AIAA SciTech 2016 conference, indicated that, in case of test-analysis correlation purposes, such uniform field does not necessarily represents the reality and might result in poor correlation outcome. Hence, the main emphasis of the current study is to investigate numerical optimization technique to closely match the acoustic field distributions in boundary element analysis to the acoustic field shape observed during the acoustic test.","Diffuse Acoustic Field Shaping in Acoustic Boundary "

From each test, the force-time,energy-time, and force-deformation were recorded. The progressive damage by repeatedimpact was analyzed visually and by calculating the degree of damage. The absorbedenergy, deection and impact force were analyzed as a function of temperature. Thesamples impacted at -50  C experienced an increase in the damage area in comparison tothe samples tested at 25  C. Due to the rigidity experienced by the specimens tested at -50 C, more impacts were needed to perforate the laminates. The degree of damage increasedand the number of impacts decreased as the impact energy increased. As a result, thetemperature have an e ect on the low-velocity response of laminated composites.","Repeated Impact Response of Woven Composites at"

Hot-drawing was applied to as-spun polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/CNTs precursor nanofibers prior to carbonization to further modify their microstructure. The evolution of microstructure of precursor hybrid nanofibers was examined by different characterization methods, such as polarized FT-IR, polarized Raman and X-Ray diffraction azimuthal, which shows an evident alignment increase of PAN chains and CNTs within PAN/CNTs nanofibers caused by hot-drawing. Effective reinforcement modulus of CNTs in 0.1 wt.% PAN/CNTs hybrid nanofibers was measured to be as high as ~2.1 TPa (nearly twice the modulus of individual CNTs), due to the formation of highly order polymer interphase with higher mechanical properties compared to bulk PAN around CNTs. Moreover, the alignment of the graphitic domains within CNFs due to hot-drawing of precursor effectively improved the electrical conductivity of CNF from 145 S/cm to 241 S/cm. On the other hand, electrical conductivity of as fabricated CNF/CNTs was lower than pure CNF due to the decreased molecular alignment of PAN in as electrospun PAN/CNT composite fibers which lowered the graphitic alignment in CNF/CNTs. However, this loss in conductivity was partially compensated for by the templating effect of CNTs. This study sets a good starting point for fabricating low cost highly conductivity CNF through exploiting the templating graphitization of CNTs.","Effect of Templating Graphitization on Electrical "

This scheme distinguishes multilevelapproaches applied to discretizations from multifidelity approaches applied to model forms, and navigatesboth hierarchies to accelerate convergence. Additive, multiplicative, or a combination of bothcorrections can be applied to the sub-problems to enforce up to second-order consistency with thefine-grid high-fidelity results. The MLMF optimization algorithm is a wrapper around a subproblemoptimization solver, and the MLMF scheme is provably convergent if the subproblem optimizeris provably convergent.

In this research, an approach to predicting loss-of-control events is developed using a Laplace-based method. The reason for this closed form analytic approach is to clearly define and illustrate the issues involved in choosing an LoC boundary. A mass spring damper system is used to illustrate the proposed concept, where a state space model is used to simulate the position and velocity of the mass with respect to time. Using the states calculated, Laplace equations are then used to calculate the force required to reach a predefined distance limit, where the limit represents a loss-of-control boundary.

3865,AIAA-2017-1033,Utilization of INS Measurements into Fixed-Point Smoothing Approach to Mitigate the Disturbance Effect of Missile Initial Heading Errors on Missile Terminal Guidance Performance,"Missile initial heading error is defined as the initial angular deviation of the missile from its collision course at the beginning of terminal homing phase. In order to compensate the initial heading error in terminal guidance, the missile applies a rapid acceleration command which results an abrupt maneuver . This abrupt maneuver causes an angular disturbance to the seeker. Thus, the seeker may provide incorrect measurements to the guidance system and cause unsuccessful engagement of the target. In this paper, aiming to mitigate the disturbance effect of initial heading error in terminal guidance, a novel algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of seeker tracking filter by using the inertial states of the missile. Position, velocity and attitude states of the missile, measured by the inertial navigation system (INS), can be utilized in a fixed-point Kalman smoothing tracking filter to prevent the degradation of the seeker measurements during the missile abrupt maneuvers caused by initial heading error. For verification, the performance of proposed algorithm is compared with tracking filter that does not utilize INS measurements. This comparison is realized via the simulation of two dimensional missile engagement scenario with non-zero initial heading error.","Utilization of INS Measurements into Fixed-Point "

The contact dynamics model considers the effect of the contact geometry of the capture interfaces. The contact control uses a combination of a resolved motion rate control method and admittance control technique, whose control goal is to reduce the relative velocity at the contact spots and increase the compliance of the robotic arm during the contacting period for capturing. A simulation example of a 3-joint manipulator approaching and capturing a rotating target object is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control methods.

While such variability can be captured by experimental testing, the prediction of such variability using virtual testing remain a challenge. The variability in transverse composite properties was determined by finite element analysis of computer simulated microstructures. Such microstructures were generated based on the statistics provided by image analysis of actual microstructures. The generated microstructures were modified to match both short and large length scale statistics of actual microstructures. This will enable generation of theoretically infinite realizations of microstructures that are statistically the same but stochastically different (have the same statistics but different configurations). Image-based finite element models were developed based on both pixel-based and morphology-based meshing. The extended finite element method was implemented in ABAQUS to predict failure initiation and progression. The results show that different realizations of microstructures have different transverse strengths but similar elastic properties.","

The proposed traffic management of UAS (TM-UAS) in the urban operations will leverage and integrate with the existing urban infrastructure to ensure efficient and safe UAS operations. The safe and efficient operations can be achieved by describing the urban airspace in terms of dynamic air blocks, whereby the communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) capability can potentially be assessed within these air blocks to define if it is safe to operate across it. The concept of dynamic airspace configuration based on UAS density is discussed. The concept of airspace phase transition threshold (APTT) whereby the airspace configuration transits from one form to another as the UAS density increases or decreases is also introduced. To enable the formulation of the airspace phase transition threshold, a preliminary study on the urban airspace complexity in terms of the pairwise conflicts between different unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) are studied. It is found that while the number of conflicts expectedly increases with the number of UAVs introduced into the airspace, the scaling factor increases polynomially, instead of exponentially. This hence gives one hope in potentially able to reduce the number of conflicts through better airspace management and UAS control.","Preliminary Concept of Operations (ConOps) for  "

This paper addresses the situationin which an AI for aerial dog  ghting, with tunable parameters that govern its behavior,must optimize behavior with respect to an objective function that is evaluated and learnedthrough simulations. Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian Process surrogate is usedas the method for investigating the objective function. One key bene t is that duringoptimization, the Gaussian Process learns a global estimate of the true objective function,with predicted outcomes and a statistical measure of con dence in areas that haven't beeninvestigated yet. Having a model of the objective function is important for being able tounderstand possible outcomes in the decision space; for example this is crucial for trainingand providing feedback to human pilots. However, standard Bayesian optimization doesnot perform consistently or provide an accurate Gaussian Process surrogate function forhighly volatile objective functions. We treat these problems by introducing a novel samplingtechnique called Hybrid Repeat/Multi-point Sampling. This technique gives the AI abilityto learn optimum behaviors in a highly uncertain environment.","Towards Adaptive Training of Agent-based Sparring"

However, the automation-centric design has ledto a new safety concern called \human-automation interaction issue"" where the expecta-tions of the pilot run contrary to the behavior of the automation system. The detectionof this dysfunctional interaction between the pilot and the automation system becomesimportant and challenging since it may cause severe aviation accidents. Our previous re-search has proposed and demonstrated an intent-based framework for human-automationinteraction issue detection in the ight deck, by abstracting the complex behavior of theautomation and the pilot using \automation intent"" and \pilot intent"", respectively. How-ever, the inference of the \automation intent"" relies on detailed mathematical models ofthe automation logic with a priori knowledge of the system parameters (e.g., capture rate)and assumed sensor noise statistics which are seldom easy to obtain. This paper proposesa new method called Generalized Fuzzy Hidden Markov Model (GFHMM) to infer theautomation intent, which requires neither a priori knowledge of the automation logic ofthe aircraft nor the model parameters.

3884,AIAA-2017-1169,Multi-Dimensional Variational Mode Decomposition Applied to Intrinsic Vibration Mode Extraction for Bearing Crack Detection in Wind Turbines with Large Speed Variation,"Bearing cracks have become a dominant cause of wind turbine gearboxfailures, and gearbox has found to be the largest contributor to turbine downtime andcostliest to repair. Since most existing techniques for vibration-based fault diagnosis weredeveloped based on the assumption that machines operate in stationary conditions, it can beineffective, and sometimes even misleading, to apply these techniques directly to bearingswith large speed/load fluctuations. Literature review indicates that some studies extendedthe fault detection techniques from stationary to non-stationary conditions; however, verylimited work has been done to address bearing crack detection under non-stationaryoperating conditions in wind turbines. To this end, this work proposes a new method forbearing crack detection, namely multidimensional variational decomposition (MDVD), inwhich variational mode decomposition (VMD) is properly incorporated into convolutiveblind source separation (CBSS) in order to address the challenge of substantial driving speedvariation. One unique property of the proposed MDVD method is the ability to deal withmulti-channel vibration signals with large speed/load fluctuations. Hence, MDVD does notimpose any restrictions on the number of sensors and their installations (e.g., installationpositions and directions), and thus overcomes the limitation of the original VMD method,which can only process a single sensor signal. An experimental validation of the proposedmethod was conducted by using bearings with axial cracks in the outer race, and acomparative study of VMD and instantaneous blind source separation (IBSS)-VMD wasperformed. The comparison showed that VMD and IBSS-VMD were affected by speedfluctuations, while the proposed MDVD method outperformed its competitors in terms ofcrack characteristics frequency purification. Hence, MDVD showed great potential forbearing crack detection in wind turbines under non-stationary operating conditions.","Multi-Dimensional Variational Mode Decomposition Applied "

Fast surrogate models are needed toalleviate the computational burden; however, the discontinuous nature of fracture dynamicspresents a major challenge to most approximation methods. We introduce an approachbased on reduced basis and sparse grids induced by piece-wise constant functions, whichdoes not require assumptions on the regularity of the model response in either parameteror real space. Using a sequence of random samples (i.e., solutions to the full model), weconstruct a small set of basis functions that capture the variability of the displacement  eldfor di erent values of the model parameters. We expand the displacement  eld as a linearcombination of these basis functions and construct an approximation to the expansioncoe cients using an `2 projection onto an adaptive sparse grid basis induced by piece-wiseconstant functions.

Dueto the inherent complexity and multi-phase nature of the turbulent ow, assessing the per-formance of such hydrofoils for a wide range of operating conditions becomes a formidabletask.

Since the model discrepancy of the simulationmodel with spatially varying parameters is also spatially varying, the discrepancy term ismodeled as a random field, following the Kennedy and O¡¯Hagan (KOH) framework. Due tothe randomness of the calibration parameters over specimens, the computational effort inBayesian calibration is increased, which brings significant challenge to evaluation of theexpected information gain. A Gaussian copula method integrated with a particle filterapproach is developed to tackle this challenge. This integration significantly increases theefficiency in estimating the information gain measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL)divergence. The optimal sensor locations are then identified using a simulated annealingalgorithm by maximizing the expected information gain.

3891,AIAA-2017-1676,Assessment of Adhesively Bonded Joint Health Status using Wavelet Spectral Finite Element Method,"The dispersion characteristics of Lamb waves propagating through an adhesively bonded lap joint assemblyare studied by varying the adhesive properties and the thickness. The results of the study are used to assess thehealth status of the adhesive layer by using the baseline data obtained from a lap joint model developed usingWavelet Spectral Finite Elements (WSFE). A conventional Finite Element (FE) model of an adhesively bondedlap joint is developed in LS-DYNA and the model is used to simulate the Lamb wave propagation through lapjoints with distinct adhesive properties and thicknesses. Initially, the adhesive properties and the thickness arefixed and the model is simulated by exerting a single-cycle tone burst signal. The time history of the out-ofplaneand the in-plane velocities are measured at a number of equidistance sensing points located on the jointand two dimensional fast Fourier transformation is employed to transform the time history data into spectraldomain. This spectral data represent the dispersion curves of the waves propagating on the lap joint assembly.The dispersion curves obtained for the fixed parameter lap joint are set as the baseline. The dispersion curvesgenerated for lap joint configurations with different adhesive properties and thicknesses are compared withthe baseline case. The fundamental antisymmetric mode is identified to be sensitive to the elastic modulus ofthe adhesive layer for relatively stiffer adhesive layers, and it is observed to be less sensitive once the adhesivebecomes softer. The A1 dispersion curve changes significantly according to the adhesive elastic modulusvariations, regardless of its relative softness. A0 mode exhibits less sensitivity to the adhesive layer thicknesswhile A1 and A2 show a considerable sensitivity. The dispersion curves obtained from WSFE model of a bondedlap joint compare very well with the dispersion curves generated from the FE model. Finally, the WSFE modelis proposed to be utilized for baseline dispersion curve generation. It is shown that the elastic modulus, bondthickness and density of the adhesive layer can be estimated through the comparison of the dispersion curveswith the baseline curve.","Assessment of Adhesively Bonded Joint Health Status "

Under the simple condition that the high frequency gain matrix CB of the infinite dimensional system is nonsingular, we will constructively prove the existence of a normal form structure using non-orthogonal projections, and from that form we will derive the zero dynamic subsystem. We also prove that the transmission zeros of the open-loop infinite dimensional system can be found from the point spectrum of the zero dynamics. Our fundamental result in this paper will use the new normal form structure to prove that an infinite dimensional linear system is Almost Strictly Dissipative (ASD) if and only if CB is symmetric and positive definite and the system transmission zeros are all exponentially stable. These results will be illustrated by application to direct adaptive control of general linear systems on a Hilbert space that are described by self-adjoint operators with compact resolvent.","Normal Form for Linear Infinite-Dimensional Systems in "

There are many studies of three-axisattitude estimation using gyros that read angular rates. Rate-integrating gyros measureintegrated rates or angular displacements, but three-axis attitude estimation using thesetypes of gyros has not been as fully investigated. This paper derives a Kalman filteringframework for attitude estimation using attitude sensors coupled with rate-integratinggyroscopes. In order to account for correlations introduced by using these gyros, the statevector must be augmented, compared with filters using traditional gyros that read angularrates. Two filters are derived in this paper. The first uses an augmented state-vector formthat estimates attitude, gyro biases, and gyro angular displacements. The second ignorescorrelations, leading to a filter that estimates attitude and gyro biases only. Simulationcomparisons are shown for both filters.","Three-Axis Attitude Estimation Using"

Growing power projection and strike capabilities of potential adversaries place existing air bases susceptible to attack and accompanying damage. Even un-sophisticated attacks can render an airfield inoperable for many hours, and prevent the launch of aircraft during a conflict. Therefore, technologies were sought to improve the ability to return an airbase to a minimum acceptable operational capability after such an attack. When damage is incurred, the local forces perform an assessment of the runway, dispose of unexploded ordnance (UXO), then perform repairs. This work focuses on applying advanced autonomous technologies to improve the post-strike assessment task, which may provide the greatest return on investment in reducing total airfield down-time.

The integration of an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) with a GPS receiver-chip provides a navigation system that has several advantages over each individual system. Since the IMU is used for providing the navigation information during GPS signal outages, it is necessary that inertial sensors have very good performance in terms of stand-alone navigation accuracy. In recent years, the improvement of advanced micro-fabrication techniques has allowed the development of Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors, which have the advantages of small volume, light-weight, high reliability and low-cost. However, due to manufacturing limitations, MEMS inertial sensors¡¯ performance is greatly affected by temperature variations, which can cause the serious drawback of low precision and even errors. Therefore, it is necessary to perform an adequate temperature compensation. This paper presents an innovative calibration method, based on the use of Back-Propagation (BP) Neural Networks and compares this method with the traditional polynomial fitting calibration technique. For both methods, the selection of terms that define the architectural configuration is discussed, such as polynomial order and network layers. Testing results indicate that Neural Networks accurately approach the non-linear relationship between MEMS gyroscope¡¯s bias and temperature and thus yield more accurate temperature compensation, allowing MEMS gyroscopes to obtain very good performance in terms of stand-alone navigation accuracy to support longer GPS signal outages.","

High spatial and temporal resolution vibration measurements and modeling are thus required for high-fidelity characterization, analysis, and prediction of the structure¡¯s dynamic phenomena. For example, high spatial density mode shapes are needed for accurate vibration-based damage localization. Also, higher order vibration modes typically contain local structural features that are essential for high-fidelity dynamic modeling of the structure. In addition, while it is possible to build a highly-refined mathematical model (e.g., a finite element model) of the structure, it needs to be experimentally validated and updated with high-resolution vibration measurements. However, it is a significant challenge to obtain high-resolution vibration measurements using traditional techniques. For example, accelerometers and strain-gauge sensors provide low spatial resolution measurements. Laser vibrometers provide high-resolution measurements, but are expensive and make sequential measurements that are time-consuming. On the other hand, digital video cameras are relatively low-cost, agile, and provide high spatial resolution, simultaneous, measurements. A new framework is presented for the blind extraction and visualization of the full-field, high-resolution, dynamic (modal) response of an operating structure from the digital video measurements using video motion manipulation and unsupervised machine learning techniques.","Full-field Structural Dynamics by Video Motion "
3952,AIAA-2017-0201,A Physics-Based Combined Creep and Fatigue Methodology for Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites,"Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are becoming the material of choice in high-performance aerospace structures due to their superior mechanical properties. Application in aerospace structures require FRPs to perform under cyclic loading. However, since FRPs are inherently anisotropic and show a variety of damage mechanisms, it is difficult to predict their fatigue. Even though a lot of empirical formulas are existing in literature to predict fatigue of composites, their use is limited to specific loading scenarios and environment. Durability prediction in composites demands physics-based methodologies, and one such approach based on the kinetic theory of fracture (KTF) was put forward previously. The fatigue damage accumulation process occurs in tandem with the creep effect, which tends to relax the strains and thereby increase the fatigue life of the composite part. Therefore, an understanding is necessary on how the relaxation due to creep affects the fatigue process of the composite structure. This combined creep and fatigue phenomenon was investigated in this research using the KTF based methodology.","A Physics-Based Combined Creep and Fatigue Methodology "

This method enables aircraft to avoid severe weather areas andadjusts the time of arrival to maintain safety intervals between aircraft. In recent times, airtraffic density has seen continued growth. However, when severe weather conditions occurin a terminal airspace with heavy traffic, aircraft are required to avoid these areas. Thiscauses a delay in the expected time of arrival and risks shortening the safety interval to thefollowing aircraft. In such a case, to maintain the safety interval, the following aircraft isrequired to adjust its arrival time by flying a longer path when it avoids severe weatherareas. However, as air traffic density increases, it becomes more difficult for air trafficcontrollers to determine appropriate and feasible paths, and this increases their workload.Therefore, to reduce the workload of air traffic controllers and realize safer and moreefficient air traffic management, a real-time severe-weather-avoidance trajectory planningmethod that enables the adjustment of arrival time is required.

The guidance algorithms generate collision avoidance maneuvers based on estimated line-of-sight rates to one or more collision threats, derived from a monocular camera image. It is assumed that the collision threats are detected and tracked as feature points by an image processing algorithm, which provides the bearing angles to each threat, but not the range. The motion of each tracked threat in the image plane is then used to estimate the rate of change of the horizontal and vertical line-of-sight angles to each potential threat. The proportional navigation based guidance law generates collision avoidance commands when the line-of-sight rates to a given threat is close to zero, which would indicate a potential collision.","

A successful Sense and Avoid (SAA) system requires reliable target state estimation, prediction, detection and declaration prior to initiating an appropriate maneuver response. SSCI has developed a performance characterization tool to quantify the component-wise and system-wide capabilities of SAA systems. This tool is demonstrated by an analysis of a specific closed-loop SAA system, developed by SSCI and referred to as the iCLEAR, which sends maneuver guidance to an autopilot and simulates piloted collision avoidance. The analysis shows that, even amid multiple sources of uncertainty, for the iCLEAR SAA system, the performance can be optimized by tuning parameters to reduce missed detection rate to zero while also reducing the false alarm rate to very close to zero.","System-level Performance Analysis of a Closed-loop Sense "
3992,AIAA-2017-0913,Cooperative Estimation of Moving Target Position Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"This paper considers the problem of cooperative estimation of a moving target usingrange only measurements employing a team of unmanned aerial vehicles. A trilaterationbased estimation problem is solved every time a particular member of the team obtainssu cient measurements (from the team). During the time intervals when the trilaterationproblem cannot be solved, each vehicle in range propagates a target model and utilizes anextended Kalman  lter to continuously estimate the target location. Since the vehicles havelimited range sensing capability, the target is not available to all team members at all times.A dynamic connection topology establishes the time varying inter-vehicle communication.Vehicles are assumed to be able to communicate their own Inertial position as well as therange to target, if available. The cooperative estimation scheme is evaluated in a simulationthat employs multiple aerial vehicles and a single moving target.","Cooperative Estimation of Moving Target Position"

3995,AIAA-2017-1998,An Advanced Actuator Line Method for Wind Energy Applications and Beyond,"The actuator line method to represent rotor aerodynamics within computational uiddynamics has been in use for more than a decade. This method applies a body forceto the ow  eld along rotating lines corresponding to the individual rotor blades andemploys tabular airfoil data to compute the force distribution. The actuator line methodis attractive because, compared to blade-resolved simulations, the required mesh is muchsimpler and the computational cost is lower. This work proposes a higher  delity variantof the actuator line method meant to  ll the space between current actuator line andblade-resolved simulations. It contains modi cations in two key areas. The  rst is thatof freestream velocity vector estimation along the line, which is necessary to compute thelift and drag along the line using tabular airfoil data. Most current methods rely on pointsampling in which the location of sampling is ambiguous. Here we test a velocity samplingmethod that uses a properly weighted integral over space, removing this ambiguity. Thesecond area of improvement is the function used to project the one-dimensional actuatorline force onto the three-dimensional uid mesh as a body force. We propose and test aprojection function that spreads the force over a region that looks something like a realblade with the hope that it will produce the blade local and near wake ow features withmore accuracy and higher  delity. Our goal is that with these two improvements, not onlywill the ow  eld predictions be enhanced, but also the spanwise loading will be mademore accurate. We refer to this combination of improvements as the advanced actuatorline method. We apply these improvements to two di erent wind turbine cases. Althoughthere is a strong wind energy motivation in our work, these advanced actuator line ideascan also be used in other applications, such as helicopter rotors.","

This work is an extension of, and directly integrated with, a previous modeling code for the generation of outer mold line geometries and meshes for tailless aircraft called VT-CST. This software is able to rapidly generate structural finite element models of aircraft based on a set of parameters which describe the outer mold line and the structural geometry. Once the input geometry and structural attribution has been specified, the model generation is completely automated. The modeling process is given in detail including the application of object-oriented programming techniques to the model generation.

4018,AIAA-2017-0135,Simple Alternative to Bayesian Multi-Fidelity Surrogate Framework,"Bayesian multi-fidelity surrogate (MFS) framework, which is equivalent to co-Kriging, performs generally well for predicting the response of a high fidelity model. Because of high computational cost to obtain high fidelity data, however, MFS prediction often relies on a model discrepancy function obtained based on scarce high fidelity data to correct the error in a low fidelity response. With a small number of high fidelity data, it only makes a sense that the discrepancy function has a simple functional form. A key contribution of this paper is to show that a simple low order polynomial can be used for the discrepancy function, instead of the Gaussian process (GP) model of the Bayesian framework with minimal loss of accuracy. This paper suggests a simple alternative to the Bayesian MFS framework using a polynomial discrepancy function model. For the Hartmann 6 example, the proposed simple framework provided MFS almost equivalent to Bayesian MFS with the difference being 3.8%. The proposed framework worked comparably well with a small number of high fidelity samples. Also a polynomial discrepancy function is more reliable than GP model for high dimensional problems.","Simple Alternative to Bayesian Multi-Fidelity Surrogate "

4027,AIAA-2017-1638,Flight Performance Optimization of a Multi-Lift Rotorcraft Formation,A numeric optimization is performed for maximizing the cruise performance of a multiliftrotorcraft system. The optimization process locates the optimal relative positions of theformation rotorcraft. The optimization problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinearprogramming problem. Constraints on the distances between the formation rotorcraft areimposed in order to maintain safe separation distances. It is shown that for every airspeed anoptimal formation geometry can be found that minimizes the rotorcraft power required.Optimization analysis for subsequent airspeeds yields an optimal recommended airspeed thatis close to the ¡°bucket¡± airspeed of the unloaded rotorcraft. Cable length is shown to have asecondary influence on optimization results. The resulting improvement in the performanceof the multi-lift system is demonstrated using nonlinear simulations. It is shown that theoperational efficiency of the system can be significantly increased by adopting the optimizationresults.,"Flight Performance Optimization of a Multi-Lift Rotorcraft "
4028,AIAA-2017-1639,Airdata-Sensor-based Relative Position Estimation for Receiver Aircraft in Aerial Refueling,"This paper presents a method to estimate the position of receiver aircraft relative tothe tanker aircraft in aerial refueling operation. In aerial refueling operations, the receiveraircraft is exposed to nonuniform wind  eld induced by tanker aircraft, and this nonuniformwind  eld leads to di erences in readings of airdata sensors that are located di erentlocations on the receiver aircraft. The goal is to use the variations of airspeed, sideslipangle and angle-of-attack measurements over the aircraft to develop a relative positionestimation system. Using the di erence in the sensors, a map of wind  eld in terms ofmagnitude and direction over an area around the refueling contact position is prepared.Several algorithms are developed that use measurements from three airdata sensors placedat di erent locations on the receiver aircraft and the inverse of the maps to estimate therelative position of the receiver with respect to the tanker.","Airdata-Sensor-based Relative Position Estimation for"

The concept of visibility is formally introduced ina modi ed pursuit-evasion di erential game, and it appears in the Lagrangian term of theplayers' cost functions. Target visibility is then quanti ed by means of a visibility function,which adds an augmentation term to the proportional navigation structure. Numericalsimulations are used for validation. A further simpli cation of the guidance law is alsopresented, using the same arguments that lead to the proportional navigation guidancesimplest expression, i.e. considering the players on a nominal collision course. The newsimpli ed law is validated in simulation, and compared against its original expression.","Visibility Augmentation of the Proportional"
4031,AIAA-2017-1014,Near Optimal Evasion from Acceleration Estimating Pursuers,"Near optimal evasion strategies from pursuers employing modern linear guidance laws,which require the evader¡¯s acceleration, are proposed. To attain small miss distances, mostmodern guidance laws use the evader¡¯s acceleration. However, the evader¡¯s acceleration cannot be directly measured and needs to be estimated. The key idea underlying the proposedapproach is to exploit the inherent time-delay associated with the estimate of the evader¡¯sacceleration to maximize the miss distance. The problem is posed in a linear boundedacceleration optimal control framework with arbitrary order linear pursuer and evaderdynamics. The evader is assumed to have perfect information on the pursuer¡¯s states,parameters, and guidance law. The pursuer is assumed to have perfect information on theevader¡¯s dynamic parameters and states, however, the pursuer¡¯s estimate of the evader¡¯sacceleration is assumed to have a pure delay. The optimal evasion strategies are derivedand can be computed in real-time by a simple integration in reverse time. Simulationresults demonstrate the viability of the proposed evasion strategies. It is shown that themiss distances achieved using the proposed strategies, against pursuers employing linearguidance laws that use target acceleration, are substantially higher than the miss distancesarchived without exploiting the inherent estimation delay.","Near Optimal Evasion"
4032,AIAA-2017-1049,Experimental Validation for Tethered Capture of Spinning Space Debris,"The space debris population has been growing steadily since Sputnik was launched in1957. Recently, the risk of cascaded collisions between debris has become a concern, asthis has the ability to render certain popular orbits too risky to continue using. Debrismitigation is important to limit the growth of the debris population, but active debrisremoval has been found to be necessary to keep the current debris quantity from growing.An active debris removal mission consists of a chaser spacecraft performing a rendezvouswith a target object, capturing it, and towing it to a disposal orbit or into the atmosphere.Capturing the debris has challenges because of residual angular momentum present in theuncooperative debris. This paper examines techniques for dissipating the angular momen-tum present in a target debris using visco-elastic tethers, through numerical simulationsand planar experiments in the Spacecraft Robotics and Control Laboratory at CarletonUniversity. Both simulation and experimental results agree that a tether con gurationwith multiple tether attachment points on a target is signi cantly faster at stabilizing aspinning debris than the currently accepted single tether con guration.","Experimental Validation for Tethered Capture of"

The critical challenges of functioning e ectivelyin such environments are (i) maximizing workspace in constrained spaces like narrow corri-dors or tight corners, and (ii) achieving stable ight when lifting payloads of unknown massin the presence of uncertainties. While aerial manipulation has been researched to someextent, few e orts have been made to address both of these challenges simultaneously.

In this paper, we describe thepreliminary design process and construction of a first generation modular Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)that is reconfigurable offline. The modules of this reconfigurable UAV platform can be assembled to form aquad-rotor UAV (QR-UAV) configuration or a fixed-wing UAV (FW-UAV) configuration, respectivelyproviding VTOL/hovering capabilities and long-endurance/range capabilities. The goal of this design effort isto develop, fabricate, and flight-test a modular and reconfigurable UAV platform that can be used bydifferent types of field personnel ¨C from wildfire firefighters, to emergency responders and-post-disastersearch and rescue teams. Hence, diverse functionality was deemed necessary along with strict maximumweight/volume specifications (backpack-carry-able modules) and the ability to be assembled/disassembled ina matter of minutes. The overall design and the first generation prototype is derived from an originalconceptual design performed using modular product platform planning concepts. The UAV modules weredefined in terms of 15 design variables, and the conceptual design optimization was performed using themixed-discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The QR configuration in this UAV comprises fourducted rotors and a central pod housing all the required electronics, including the battery. In addition to allthe modules in the QR configuration, the FW configuration includes a multi-section flying wing with verticaland horizontal stabilizers, where the ducted rotors are mounted on the bottom (1st generation concept) or thetop (2nd generation concept) of the wing. In developing the detailed design, it was conceived that the majorityof the UAV would be fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques.

One critical application domain for Unmanned AerialSystems (UAS) streaming is border security, mapping and precise agriculture. Regardingthe first issue, the current political evolutions in the wide region of south eastern Europeanterritory reveals the significance for a wide surveillance. This is also valid in agriculture toget a more precise and high quality production. However, efficient access to video datalocated on Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) and real-time streaming is an arduous taskdue to large bandwidth requirements imposed by the video sequences and the unstablecapacity and bandwidth of the wireless channel. In addition, the traditional representationof a video sequence as a stream of consecutive frames is not reliable for new emergingapplications needed in aerial vehicles such as content indexing, retrieval and non-linearaccess and browsing. This reveals the need for the implementation of non-linear toolsenabling the efficient summarization of the visual content.

4036,AIAA-2017-1318,Automated Route Clustering for Air Traffic Modeling,"An approach for identifying and approximating well-traveled routes in a historicaldataset of ight trajectories is presented. The intent is to use these routes to construct anetwork model of air tra c ow for use in strategic planning. The ight trajectories areclustered based on spatial and dynamic similarity measures. A coarse clustering process rst groups trajectories using origin, destination, and average ground speed information;then a  ne clustering process uses the Fr echet distance between pairs of trajectories inthe coarse clusters as the more accurate measure of spatial similarity to further dividethe trajectories into smaller clusters. The number of resulting clusters is automaticallydetermined by employing a combination of three performance indices. This two-step clu-stering process has two bene ts. It reduces the computational burden because the Fr echetdistance computations are required for fewer trajectory pairs due to the initial coarseclustering step. Secondly no manual tuning is required to determine the  nal numberof clusters. A method of detecting and categorizing outliers is presented which  ts wellwith the clustering process. The clustering and outlier processes are demonstrated on anhistorical dataset for a region composed of 6 Centers with 21 airports.","Automated Route Clustering for Air Tra?c Modeling"

MnADRP is a hybrid space vehicle consisting of one mother spacecraft carrying multiple nanosatellites. MnADRP performs multiple debris removal by sequentially transferring to the vicinity of a space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and releases the nanosatellites for removal operations. The goal of this work is to derive a joint debris selection and removal scheduling method for multiple debris removal missions with MnADRP that maximizes the aggregate benefit of removing selected debris, while (i) minimizing the energy to transfer, (ii) minimizing the consumption of nanosatellite payloads, and (iii) satisfying the total time duration and budget constraints of the mission. A multi-dimensional Pareto frontal surface criterion is incorporated in the fitness function to evaluate solutions generated by the genetic algorithm more efficiently. Based on real-world model parameters, extensive numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed debris selection and removal scheduling method. Compared to the conventional NSGA-II algorithm, the proposed algorithm yields better solutions and consumes less computing time.","A Multi-Objective Planning Method for Multi-Debris Active "

In thiswork, we consider a NLTP system model for a two-degree-of-freedom FWMAV that iscon ned to move along vertical rails. We combine tools from chronological calculus, geo-metric control, and averaging to provide a mathematically rigorous analysis for the balanceof FWMAVs at hover; that is, relaxing the single-body and direct averaging assumptionsthat are commonly adopted in analyzing balance and stability of FWMAVs and insects. Wealso use optimized shooting to numerically capture the resulting periodic orbit and verifythe obtained results. Finally, we provide a combined averaging-shooting approach for thebalance and stability analysis of NLTP systems that (i) unlike typical shooting methods,does not require an initial guess; (ii) provides more accurate results than the analytical av-eraging approaches, hence relaxing the need for intractable high-order averaged dynamics;and (iii) allows a deeper scrutiny of the system dynamics, in contrast to numerical shootingmethods.","A combined Averaging-Shooting Approach for the"

Certification challenges, however, prevent the use of adaptive controllers in aircraft. The stability arguments of adaptive controllers require that the plant is minimum phase and that it has a non-zero high frequency gain. In aircraft, these conditions are not readily met. This investigation presents a sensor blending methodology that allows for these conditions to be met. This methodology was then used to develop an adaptive autopilot without obtaining an initial estimate of the plant dynamics. The autopilot is capable of three-dimensional navigation while changing flap configurations as well as performing an ILS approach. Turbulence and wind gusts were added to test the controller¡¯s robustness, and the autopilot was able to maintain its performance.","

However, their use in safety critical systems like aircrafts is limited due to thenon-availability of tools to comprehensively evaluate in advance, the performance and ro-bustness of the designed adaptive controller. To overcome the above di culties, this paperproposes an online data-driven veri cation and tuning method. In this approach, multi-ple adaptive control schemes run in parallel and the best scheme is selected at each stepbased on collected data. Optimal switching between di erent adaptive schemes is achievedthrough a data-driven control theory concept called 'Unfalsi ed adaptive control'. Thiscollaborative adaptive control scheme is expected to provide superior performance as com-pared to a single adaptive control scheme. Furthermore, a class of data-driven cost functionsthat are cost detectable is used to detect instability. This in turn improves the robustnessof the switching control, for candidate adaptive schemes.
